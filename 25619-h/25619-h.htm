<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary to say that I use
the term Mystic, as applied to the larger portion of
this volume, in its technical sense to signify my
own <i>initiation</i> into some of the more occult phases of
metropolitan existence. It is only to the Spiritualistic,
or concluding portion of my work, that the word
applies in its ordinary signification.</p>

<h3>LONDON ARABS.</h3>


<p>Of all the protean forms of misery that meet us in the
bosom of that "stony-hearted stepmother, London,"
there is none that appeals so directly to our sympathies
as the spectacle of a destitute child. In the
case of the grown man or woman, sorrow and suffering
are often traceable to the faults, or at best to the
misfortunes of the sufferers themselves; but in the
case of the child they are mostly, if not always,
vicarious. The fault, or desertion, or death of the
natural protectors, turns loose upon the desert of our
streets those nomade hordes of Bedouins, male and
female, whose presence is being made especially palpable
just now, and whose reclamation is a perplexing,
yet still a hopeful problem. In the case of the adult
Arab, there is a life's work to undo, and the facing
of that fact it is which makes some of our bravest
workers drop their hands in despair. With these
young Arabs, on the contrary, it is only the wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bias of a few early years to correct, leaving carte
blanche for any amount of hope in youth, maturity,
and old age. Being desirous of forming, for my own
edification, some notion of the amount of the evil
existing, and the efforts made to counteract it, I
planned a pilgrimage into this Arabia Infelix&mdash;this
Petr&aelig;a of the London flagstones; and purpose setting
down here, in brief, a few of my experiences, for the
information of stay-at-home travellers, and still more
for the sake of pointing out to such as may be disposed
to aid in the work of rescuing these little Arabs
the proper channels for their beneficence. Selecting,
then, the Seven Dials and Bethnal Green as the foci
of my observation in West and East London respectively,
I set out for the former one bleak March night,
and by way of breaking ground, applied to the first
police-constable I met on that undesirable beat for
information as to my course. After one or two
failures, I met with an officer literally "active and
intelligent," who convoyed me through several of
that network of streets surrounding the Seven Dials,
leaving me to my own devices when he had given me
the general bearings of the district it would be
desirable to visit.</p>

<p>My first raid was on the Ragged School and Soup
Kitchen in Charles Street, Drury Lane, an evil-looking
and unfragrant locality; but the institution
in question stands so close to the main thoroughfare
that the most fastidious may visit it with ease. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
I found some twenty Arabs assembled for evening
school. They were of all ages, from seven to fifteen,
and their clothing was in an inverse ratio to their
dirt&mdash;very little of the former, and a great deal of the
latter. They moved about with their bare feet in the
most feline way, like the veritable Bedouin himself.
There they were, however, over greasy slates and
grimy copy-books, in process of civilization. The
master informed me that his special difficulties arose
from the attractions of the theatre and the occasional
intrusion of wild Arabs, who came only to kick up a
row. At eight o'clock the boys were to be regaled
with a brass band practice, so, finding from one of
the assembled Arabs that there was a second institution
of the kind in King Street, Long Acre, I
passed on thereto. Here I was fortunate enough to
find the presiding genius in the person of a young
man engaged in business during the day, and devoting
his extra time to the work of civilizing the barbarians
of this district. Sunday and week-day services, night
schools, day schools, Bands of Hope, temperance
meetings, and last, not least, the soup kitchen, were
the means at work here. Not a single officer is paid.
The task is undertaken "all for love, and nothing for
reward," and it has thriven so far that my presence
interrupted a debate between the gentleman above-mentioned
and one of his coadjutors on the subject of
taking larger premises. The expenses were met by
the weekly offerings, and I was surprised to see by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
notice posted in the room where the Sunday services
are held, that the sum total for the past week was
only 19<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> So there must be considerable sacrifice
of something more than time to carry on this admirable
work. Under the guidance of the second
gentleman mentioned above, I proceeded to the St.
George's and St. Giles's Refuge in Great Queen Street,
where boys are admitted on their own application, the
only qualification being destitution. Here they are
housed, clothed, boarded, and taught such trades as
they may be fitted for, and not lost sight of until they
are provided with situations. A hundred and fifty-four
was the number of this truly miraculous draught
from the great ocean of London streets, whom I saw
all comfortably bedded in one spacious dormitory.
Downstairs were the implements and products of the
day's work, dozens of miniature cobblers' appliances,
machines for sawing and chopping firewood, &amp;c.,
whilst, in a spacious refectory on the first floor, I was
informed, the resident Arabs extended on a Friday
their accustomed hospitality to other tribes, to such
an extent, that the party numbered about 500. Besides
the 154 who were fortunate enough to secure
beds, there were twenty new arrivals, who had to be
quartered on the floor for the night; but at all events
they had a roof above them, and were out of the cruel
east wind that made Arabia Petr&aelig;a that evening an
undesirable resting-place indeed. Lights were put
out, and doors closed, when I left, as this is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
night refuge; but notices are posted, I am informed,
in the various casual wards and temporary
refuges, directing boys to this. There is a
kindred institution for girls in Broad Street. Such
was my first experience of the western portion of
Arabia Infelix.</p>

<p>The following Sunday I visited the Mission Hall
belonging to Bloomsbury Chapel, in Moor Street,
Soho, under the management of Mr. M'Cree, and the
nature of the work is much the same as that pursued
at King Street. The eleven o'clock service was on
this particular day devoted to children, who were
assembled in large numbers, singing their cheerful
hymns, and listening to a brief, practical, and taking
address. These children, however, were of a class
above the Arab type, being generally well dressed.
I passed on thence to what was then Mr. Brock's
chapel, where I found my veritable Arabs, whom I
had seen in bed the previous evening, arrayed in a
decent suit of "sober livery," and perched up in a
high gallery to gather what they could comprehend
of Mr. Brock's discourse&mdash;not very much, I should
guess; for that gentleman's long Latinized words
would certainly fire a long way over their heads, high
as was their position. I found the whole contingent
of children provided for at the refuge was 400, including
those on board the training ship <i>Chichester</i>
and the farm at Bisley, near Woking, Surrey. This
is certainly the most complete way of dealing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Arabs par excellence, as it contemplates the case
of utter destitution and homelessness. It need
scarcely be said, however, that such a work must
enlarge its boundaries very much, in order to make
any appreciable impression on the vast amount of
such destitution. Here, nevertheless, is the germ,
and it is already fructifying most successfully. The
other institutions, dealing with larger masses of
children, aim at civilizing them at home, and so
making each home a centre of influence.</p>

<p>Passing back again to the King Street Mission
Hall, I found assembled there the band of fifty
missionaries, male and female, who visit every Sunday
afternoon the kitchens of the various lodging-houses
around the Seven Dials. Six hundred kitchens are
thus visited every week. After roll-call, and a brief
address, we sallied forth, I myself accompanying Mr.
Hatton&mdash;the young man to whom the establishment
of the Mission is due&mdash;and another of his missionaries.
I had heard much of the St. Giles's Kitchens, but
failed to realize any idea of the human beings swarming
by dozens and scores in those subterranean
regions. Had it not been for the fact that nearly
every man was smoking, the atmosphere would have
been unbearable. In most of the kitchens they were
beguiling the ennui of Sunday afternoon with cards;
but the game was invariably suspended on our arrival.
Some few removed their hats&mdash;for all wore them&mdash;and
a smaller number still joined in a verse or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of a hymn, and listened to a portion of Scripture and
a few words of exhortation. One or two seemed
interested, others smiled sardonically; the majority
kept a dogged silence. Some read their papers and
refused the tracts and publications offered them.
These, I found, were the Catholics. I was assured
there were many men there who themselves, or whose
friends, had occupied high positions. I was much
struck with the language of one crop-headed young
fellow of seventeen or eighteen, who, seeing me grope
my way, said, "They're not very lavish with the gas
here, sir, are they?" It may appear that this "experience"
has little bearing on the Arab boys; but
really some of the inmates of these kitchens <i>were</i> but
boys. Those we visited were in the purlieus of the
old "Rookery," and for these dens, I was informed,
the men paid fourpence a night! Surely a little
money invested in decent dwellings for such people
would be well and even remuneratively spent. The
kitchens, my informant&mdash;who has spent many years
among them&mdash;added, are generally the turning point
between honesty and crime. The discharged soldier
or mechanic out of work is there herded with the
professional thief or burglar, and learns his trade
and gets to like his life.</p>

<p>The succeeding evening I devoted first of all to
the Girls' Refuge, 19, Broad Street, St. Giles's. Here
were sixty-two girls of the same class as the boys in
Great Queen Street, who remain until provided with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
places as domestic servants. A similar number were
in the Home at Ealing. The Institution itself is the
picture of neatness and order. I dropped in quite
unexpectedly; and any visitor who may be induced
to follow my example, will not fail to be struck with
the happy, "homely" look of everything, the clean,
cheerful appearance of the female Arabs, and the
courtesy and kindness of the matron. These girls
are considered to belong to St. Giles's parish, as the
boys to Bloomsbury Chapel. So far the good work
has been done by the Dissenters and Evangelical
party in the Established Church. The sphere of the
High Church&mdash;as I was reminded by the Superintendent
Sergeant&mdash;is the Newport Market Refuge
and Industrial Schools. Here, besides the male and
female refuges, is a Home for Destitute Boys, who
are housed and taught on the same plan as at St.
Giles's. Their domicile is even more cosy than the
other, and might almost tempt a boy to act the
part of an "amateur Arab." I can only say the
game that was going on, previously to bed, in the
large covered play room, with bare feet and in shirt
sleeves, was enough to provoke the envy of any
member of a Dr. Blimber's "Establishment." The
Institution had just had a windfall in the shape of
one of those agreeable 1000<i>l.</i> cheques that have been
flying about lately, or their resources would have
been cramped; but the managers are wisely sensible
that such windfalls do not come every day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and so forbear enlarging their borders as they could
wish.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the Roman Catholics, who
usually outdo us in their work among the poor, seemed
a little behindhand in this special department of
settling the Arabs. They have schools largely
attended in Tudor Place, Tottenham Court Road,
White Lion Street, Seven Dials, &amp;c., but, as far as I
could ascertain, nothing local in the shape of a Refuge.
To propagate the faith may be all very well, and will
be only the natural impulse of a man sincere in his
own belief; but we must not forget that these Arabs
have bodies as well as souls, and that those bodies
have been so shamefully debased and neglected as to
drag the higher energies down with them; and it is a
great question whether it is not absolutely necessary
to begin on the very lowest plane first, and so to
work towards the higher. Through the body and
the mind we may at last reach the highest sphere
of all.</p>

<p>Without for one moment wishing to write down the
"religious" element, it is, I repeat, a grave question
whether the premature introduction of that element
does not sometimes act as a deterrent, and frustrate
the good that might otherwise be done. Still there
is the great fact, good <i>is</i> being done. It would be
idle to carp at any means when the end is so
thoroughly good. I could not help, as I passed
from squalid kitchen to kitchen that Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
afternoon, feeling Lear's words ring through my
mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">O, I have ta'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show the heavens more just.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now "Eastward ho!" for "experiences" in
Bethnal Green.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>EAST LONDON ARABS.</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding my previous experiences among
the Western tribes of Bedouins whose locale is the
Desert of the Seven Dials, I must confess to considerable
strangeness when first I penetrated the wilderness
of Bethnal Green. Not only was it utterly terra incognita
to me, but, with their manifold features in
common, the want and squalor of the East have traits
distinct from those of the West. I had but the name
of one Bethnal Green parish and of one lady&mdash;Miss
Macpherson&mdash;and with these slender data I proceeded
to my work, the results of which I again
chronicle seriatim.</p>

<p>Passing from the Moorgate Street Station I made
for the Eastern Counties Terminus at Shoreditch, and
soon after passing it struck off to my right in the
Bethnal Green Road. Here, amid a pervading atmosphere
of bird-fanciers and vendors of live pets in
general, I found a Mission Hall, belonging to I know
not what denomination, and, aided by a vigorous
policeman, kicked&mdash;in the absence of knocker or bell&mdash;at
all the doors, without result. Nobody was there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I went on to the Bethnal Green parish which had
been named to me as the resort of nomade tribes, and
found the incumbent absent in the country for a week
or so, and the Scripture-reader afraid, in his absence,
to give much information. He ventured, however, to
show me the industrial school, where some forty
children were employed in making match-boxes for
Messrs. Bryant and May. However, as I was told
that the incumbent in question objected very decidedly
to refuges and ragged schools, and thought it much
better for the poor to strain a point and send their
little ones to school, I felt that was hardly the regimen
to suit my Arabian friends, who were evidently
teeming in that locality. I was even returning
home with the view of getting further geographical
particulars of this Eastern Arabia Petr&aelig;a, when,
as a last resource, I was directed to a refuge in
Commercial Street. I rang here, and found myself
in the presence of the veritable Miss Macpherson
herself, with whom I passed two pleasant and instructive
hours.</p>

<p>At starting, Miss Macpherson rather objected to
being made the subject of an article&mdash;first of all, for
the very comprehensible reason that such publicity
would draw down upon her a host of visitors; and
when I suggested that visitors probably meant funds,
she added a second, and not quite so comprehensible
an objection&mdash;that these funds themselves might alloy
the element of Faith in which the work had been so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
far carried on. She had thoroughly imbibed the spirit
of M&uuml;ller, whose Home at Bristol was professedly the
outcome of Faith and Prayer alone. However, on my
promise to publish only such particulars&mdash;name, locality,
&amp;c.&mdash;as she might approve, this lady gave me
the details of her truly wonderful work. The building
in which I found her had been erected to serve as
large warehouses, and here 110 of the most veritable
Arabs were housed, fed, taught, and converted into
Christians, when so convertible. Should they prove
impressionable, Miss Macpherson then contemplates
their emigration to Canada. Many had already been
sent out; and her idea was to extend her operations
in this respect: not, be it observed, to cast
hundreds of the scum of the East End of London
upon Canada&mdash;a proceeding to which the Canadians
would very naturally object&mdash;but to form a Home on
that side to be fed from the Homes on this, and so to
remove from the old scenes of vice and temptation
those who had been previously trained in the refuges
here. She has it in contemplation to take a large
hotel in Canada, and convert it into an institution of
this kind; and I fancy it was the possibility that publicity
might aid this larger scheme which eventually
induced the good lady to let the world so far know
what she is doing. At all events, she gave me
carte blanche to publish the results of my observations.</p>

<p>In selecting and dealing with the inmates of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
refuges, Miss Macpherson avails herself of the science
of phrenology, in which she believes, and she advances
good reason for so doing. I presume my phrenological
development must have been satisfactory, since
she not only laid aside her objection to publicity, but
even allowed me to carry off with me her MS. "casebooks,"
from which I cull one or two of several
hundred:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. T. S., aged ten (March 5, 1869).&mdash;An orphan.
Mother died in St. George's Workhouse. Father
killed by coming in contact with a diseased sheep,
being a slaughterman. A seller of boxes in the street.
Slept last in a bed before Christmas. Slept in hay-carts,
under a tarpaulin. Says the prayers his mother
'teached him.'"</p>

<p>"2. J. H., aged twelve (March 5).&mdash;No home but
the streets. Father killed by an engine-strap, being
an engineer. Mother died of a broken heart. Went
into &mdash;&mdash; Workhouse; but ran away through ill-treatment
last December. Slept in ruins near Eastern
Counties Railway. <i>Can't remember</i> when he last lay
in a bed."</p>

<p>"3. A. R., aged eleven (March 5).&mdash;Mother and
father left him and two brothers in an empty room in
H&mdash;&mdash; Street. Policeman, hearing them crying, broke
open the door and took them to the workhouse. His
two brothers died. Was moved from workhouse by
grandmother, and she, unable to support him, turned
him out on the streets. Slept in railway ruins; lived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by begging. July 24, sent to Home No. 1 as a reward
for good conduct."</p>

<p>Besides thus rescuing hundreds of homeless ones,
Miss Macpherson has in many instances been the
means of restoring runaway children of respectable
parents. Here is an instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Feb. 25th.&mdash;S. W. T., aged fourteen, brought
into Refuge by one of the night teachers, who noticed
him in a lodging-house respectably dressed. Had
walked up to London from N&mdash;&mdash;, in company with
two sailors (disreputable men, whom the lodging-house
keeper declined to take in). Had been reading
sensational books. Wrote to address at N&mdash;&mdash;.
Father telegraphed to keep him. Uncle came for him
with fresh clothes and took him home. He had
begun to pawn his clothes for his night's lodging.
His father had been for a fortnight in communication
with the police."</p>

<p>The constables in the neighbourhood all know Miss
Macpherson's Refuge, and her readiness to take boys
in at any time; so that many little vagrants are
brought thither by them and reclaimed, instead of
being locked up and sent to prison, to go from bad
to worse. Besides this receptacle for boys, Miss
Macpherson has also a Home at Hackney, where girls
of the same class are housed. The plan she adopts is
to get a friend to be responsible for one child. The
cost she reckons at 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per annum for those under
ten years, and 10<i>l.</i> for those above.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>But this excellent lady's good works are by no
means catalogued yet. Besides the children being
fed and taught in these Homes, the parents and
children are constantly gathered for sewing classes,
tea meetings, &amp;c. at the Refuge. Above 400 children
are thus influenced; and Miss Macpherson, with her
coadjutors, systematically visits the wretched dens and
lodging-houses into which no well-dressed person,
unless favourably known like her for her work among
the children, would dare to set foot. I was also
present when a hearty meal of excellent soup and a
large lump of bread were given to between three and
four hundred men, chiefly dock labourers out of
employ. It was a touching sight to notice the stolid
apathy depicted on most of the countenances, which
looked unpleasantly like despair. One of the men
assured me that for every package that had to be
unladen from the docks there were ten pair of hands
ready to do the work, where only one could be employed.
Many of the men, he assured me, went for
two, sometimes three, days without food; and with
the large majority of those assembled the meal they
were then taking would represent the whole of their
subsistence for the twenty-four-hours. After supper a
hymn was sung, and a few words spoken to them by
Miss Macpherson on the allegory of the Birds and
Flowers in the Sermon on the Mount; and so they
sallied forth into the darkness of Arabia Petr&aelig;a. I
mounted to the little boys' bedroom, where the tiniest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Arabs of all were enjoying the luxury of a game,
with bare feet, before retiring. Miss Macpherson
dragged a mattress off one of the beds and threw
it down in the centre for them to tumble head-over-tail;
and, as she truly said, it was difficult to
recognise in those merry shouts and happy faces
any remains of the veriest reprobates of the London
streets.</p>

<p>Let us hear Miss Macpherson herself speak. In a
published pamphlet, "Our Perishing Little Ones,"
she says: "As to the present state of the mission, we
simply say 'Come and see.' It is impossible by words
to give an idea of the mass of 120,000 precious souls
who live on this one square mile.... My longing
is to send forth, so soon as the ice breaks, 500 of our
poor street boys, waifs and strays that have been
gathered in, to the warm-hearted Canadian farmers.
In the meantime, who will help us to make outfits,
and collect 5<i>l.</i> for each little Arab, that there be no
hindrance to the complement being made up when the
spring time is come?... Ladies who are householders
can aid us much in endeavours to educate
these homeless wanderers to habits of industry by
sending orders for their firewood&mdash;4<i>s.</i> per hundred
bundles, sent free eight miles from the City." And,
again, in Miss Macpherson's book called "The Little
Matchmakers," she says: "In this work of faith and
labour of love among the very lowest in our beloved
country, let us press on, looking for great things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Preventing sin and crime is a much greater work
than curing it. There are still many things on my
heart requiring more pennies. As they come, we will
go forward."</p>

<p>Miss Macpherson's motto is, "The Word first in
all things; afterwards bread for this body." There
are some of us who would be inclined to reverse this
process&mdash;to feed the body and educate the mind&mdash;not
altogether neglecting spiritual culture, even at the
earliest stage, but leaving anything like definite religious
schooling until the poor mind and body were,
so to say, acclimatized. It is, of course, much
easier to sit still and theorize and criticise than to do
what these excellent people have done and are doing to
diminish this gigantic evil. "By their fruits ye shall
know them" is a criterion based on authority that we
are none of us inclined to dispute. Miss Macpherson
boasts&mdash;and a very proper subject for boasting it is&mdash;that
she belongs to no <i>ism</i>. It is significant, however,
that the Refuge bears, or bore, the name of the
"Revival" Refuge, and the paper which contained
the earliest accounts of its working was called the
<i>Revivalist</i>, though now baptized with the broader title
of the <i>Christian</i>. Amid such real work it would be a
pity to have the semblance of unreality, and I dreaded
to think of the possibility of its existing, when little
grimy hands were held out by boys volunteering to
say a text for my behoof. By far the most favourite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one was "Jesus wept;" next came "God is love"&mdash;each
most appropriate; but the sharp boy, a few years
older, won approval by a longer and more doctrinal
quotation, whilst several of these held out hands again
when asked whether, in the course of the day, they
had felt the efficacy of the text given on the previous
evening, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep
Thou the door of my lips." Such an experience
would be a sign of advanced spirituality in an adult.
Is it ungenerous to ask whether its manifestation in
an Arab child must not be an anticipation of what
might be the normal result of a few years' training?
May not this kind of <i>forcing</i> explain the cases I saw
quoted in the books&mdash;of one boy who "felt like a fish
out of water, and left the same day of his own accord;"
another who "climbed out of a three-floor
window and escaped?"</p>

<p>However, here is the good work being done. Let
us not carp at the details, but help it on, unless we
can do better ourselves. One thing has been preeminently
forced in upon me during this brief examination
of our London Arabs&mdash;namely, that individuals
work better than communities amongst these people.
The work done by the great establishments, whether
of England, Rome, or Protestant Dissent, is insignificant
compared with that carried out by persons
labouring like Mr. Hutton in Seven Dials and Miss
Macpherson in Whitechapel, untrammelled by any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
particular system. The want, and sorrow, and suffering
are individual, and need individual care, just as
the Master of old worked Himself, and sent His
scripless missionaries singly forth to labour for Him,
as&mdash;on however incommensurate a scale&mdash;they are
still labouring, East and West, amongst our London
Arabs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>LONDON ARABS IN CANADA.</h3>


<p>In the previous chapter an account was given of the
Arabs inhabiting that wonderful "square mile" in
East London, which has since grown to be so familiar
in men's mouths. The labours of Miss Macpherson
towards reclaiming these waifs and strays in her
"Refuge and Home of Industry, Commercial Street,
Spitalfields," were described at some length, and
allusion was at the same time made to the views which
that lady entertained with regard to the exportation of
those Arabs to Canada after they should have undergone
a previous probationary training in the "Home."
A short time afterwards it was my pleasing duty to
witness the departure of one hundred of these young
boys from the St. Pancras Station, en route for Canada;
and it now strikes me that some account of the voyage
out, in the shape of excerpts from the letters of the
devoted ladies who themselves accompanied our Arabs
across the Atlantic, may prove interesting; while, at
the same time, a calculation of their probable success
in their new life and homes may not improbably
stimulate those who cannot give their time, to give at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
least their countenance, and it may be, their material
aid, to a scheme which recommends itself to all our
sympathies&mdash;the permanent reclamation of the little
homeless wanderers of our London streets.</p>

<p>The strange old rambling "Home" in Commercial
Street, built originally for warehouses, then used as a
cholera hospital, and now the Arab Refuge, presented
a strange appearance during the week before the
departure of the chosen hundred. On the ground-floor
were the packages of the young passengers; on
the first floor the "new clothes, shirts, and stockings,
sent by kind lady friends from all parts of the kingdom,
trousers and waistcoats made by the widows,
and the boots and pilot jackets made by the boys
themselves." The dormitory was the great store-closet
for all the boys' bags filled with things needful
on board ship; and on the top floor, we can well
imagine, the last day was a peculiarly melancholy
one. The work attendant upon the boys' last meal
at the Refuge was over, and there, in the long narrow
kitchen, stood the cook wiping away her tears with
her apron, and the six little waiting maids around
them, with the novel feeling of having nothing to do&mdash;there, where
so much cutting, buttering, and
washing-up had been the order of the day. When
the summons came to start, the police had great difficulty
in clearing a way for the boys to the vans
through the surging mass of East London poverty.
Some of the little match-box makers ran all the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
miles from Commercial Street to St. Pancras Station
to see the very last of their boy-friends.</p>

<p>Derby was the stopping-place on the journey to
Liverpool, and the attention of passengers and guards
was arrested by this strange company gathering on
the platform at midnight and singing two of the
favourite Refuge hymns. Liverpool was reached at
4 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and the boys filed off in fours, with their
canvas bags over their shoulders, to the river side,
where their wondering eyes beheld the <i>Peruvian</i>,
which was to bear them to their new homes.</p>

<p>At this point, Miss Macpherson's sister&mdash;who is
carrying on the work of the Refuge during that lady's
absence&mdash;wrote as follows:&mdash;"Could our Christian
friends have seen the joy that beamed in the faces of
those hundred lads from whom we have just parted&mdash;could
they know the misery, the awful precipice of
crime and sin from which they have been snatched&mdash;we
are sure their hearts would be drawn out in love
for those little ones. If still supported," she continues,
"I hope to send out another party of fifty boys and fifty
girls while my sister remains in Canada, and shall be
happy to forward the name and history of a boy or
girl to any kind friend wishing to provide for a special
case. In the broad fields of that new country where
the farmers are only too glad to adopt healthy young
boys or girls into their families, hundreds of our
perishing little ones may find a happy home."</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 12th of May, the <i>Peruvian</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dropped down the river; and, as the last batch of
friends left her when she passed out into the Channel,
these one hundred boys, with Miss Macpherson,
leaned over the bulwarks, singing the hymn, "Yes,
we part, but not for ever."</p>

<p>From Derry Miss Macpherson wrote under date
May 13th:&mdash;"With the exception of two, all are on
deck now, as bright as larks; they have carried up
poor Jack Frost and Franks the runner. It is most
touching to see them wrap them up in their rugs.
Michael Flinn, the Shoreditch shoeblack, was up all
night, caring for the sick boys. Poor Mike! He
and I have exchanged nods at the Eastern Counties
Railway corner these five years. It is a great joy to
give him such a chance for life."</p>

<p>The voyage out was prosperous enough, though
there were some contrary winds, and a good deal of
sea-sickness among the lads. The captain seems to
have been quite won by the self-denying kindness of
the ladies, and he lightened their hands by giving
occupation to the boys. Then came out the result of
training at the Refuge. Those who had been some
time there showed themselves amenable to discipline;
but the late arrivals were more fractious, and difficult
to manage. These were the lads "upon whom," as
Miss Macpherson says, "the street life had left sore
marks." Even when only nearing the American
coast, this indomitable lady's spirit is planning a
second expedition. "As far as I dare make plans, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
should like to return, starting from Montreal July
16th, reaching the Home July 27th; and then return
with another lot the second week in August. This
second lot must be lads who are now under influence,
and who have been not less than six months in a
refuge." The finale to this second letter, written
from Canada, adds: "The boys, <i>to a man</i>, behaved
splendidly. The agent's heart is won. All have
improved by the voyage, and many are brown hearty-looking
chaps fit for any toil."</p>

<p>In the <i>Montreal Herald</i>, of May 27th, there is an
account of these boys after their arrival, which says:&mdash;"Miss
Macpherson is evidently a lady whose capacity
for organization and command is of the very highest
order; for boys, in most hands, are not too easily
managed, but in hers they were as obedient as a company
of soldiers.... These boys will speedily be
placed in positions, where they will grow up respectable
and respected members of society, with access to
the highest positions in the country freely open to
them.... We hope that Miss Macpherson will
place all her boys advantageously, and will bring us
many more. She is a benefactor to the Empire in
both hemispheres."</p>

<p>The importance of this testimony can scarcely be
overrated, since many persons hold themselves aloof
from a work of this nature through a feeling that it is
not fair to draft our Arab population on a colony. It
will be seen, however, that it is not proposed to export<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
these boys until they shall have been brought well
under influence, and so have got rid of what Miss
Macpherson so graphically terms the "sore marks of
their street life."</p>

<p>Apropos of this subject, it may not be irrelevant to
quote a communication which has been received from
Sir John Young, the Governor-General of Canada,
dated Ottawa, May 3rd, 1870:&mdash;"For emigrants able
and willing to work, Canada offers at present a very
good prospect. The demand for agricultural labourers
in Ontario during the present year is estimated at
from 30,000 to 40,000; and an industrious man may
expect to make about one dollar a day throughout the
year, if he is willing to turn his hand to clearing land,
threshing, &amp;c., during the winter. But it is of no
use for emigrants to come here unless they make up
their minds to take whatever employment offers itself
most readily, without making difficulties because it is
not that to which they have been accustomed, or
which they prefer."</p>

<p>I visited the Refuge and Home of Industry a few
nights afterwards, and, though Miss Macpherson was
absent, found all in working order. Sixty-three boys
were then its occupants. The superintendent was
anxiously looking forward to be able to carry out the
plan of despatching fifty boys and fifty girls during the
ensuing summer. The sum required for an East End
case is 5<i>l.</i>; for a special case, 10<i>l.</i> The following are
specimens of about sixty cases of boys whom she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
would like to send out, knowing that in Canada they
could readily obtain places:&mdash;</p>

<p>P. E., aged seventeen.&mdash;Mother died of fever,
leaving seven children; father a dock labourer, but
cannot get full employment.</p>

<p>L. J., aged thirteen.&mdash;Mother dead; does not know
where her father is; has been getting her living by
singing songs in the lodging-houses; is much improved
by her stay in the Home, and will make a
tidy little maid. This is just one of the many
who might thus be rescued from a life of sin and
misery.</p>

<p>Returning home through the squalid streets that
night, where squatters were vending old shoes and
boots that seemed scarcely worth picking out of the
kennel, and garments that appeared beneath the
notice of the rag merchant, I saw the little Bedouins
still in full force, just as though no effort had been
made for their reclamation and housing. As they
crowded the doorsteps, huddled in the gutters, or
vended boxes of lights and solicited the honour of
shining "your boots, sir," I could not help picturing
them crossing the sea, under kindly auspices, to the
"better land" beyond, and anon, in the broad Canadian
fields or busy Canadian towns, growing into
respectable farmers and citizens; and straightway
each little grimed, wan face seemed to bear a new
interest for me, and to look wistfully up into mine
with a sort of rightful demand on my charity, saying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to me, and through me to my many readers, "Come
and help us!"</p>

<p>After the foregoing was written, a further letter
arrived from Miss Macpherson. All the boys were
well placed. The agent at Quebec wished to take the
whole hundred in a lump, but only eleven were conceded
to him. At Montreal, too, all would have been
taken, but twenty-one only were left. All found
excellent situations, many as house servants at 10<i>l.</i>
and 15<i>l.</i> a year. Eight were in like manner left at
Belleville, half way between Montreal and Toronto.
Sixty were taken on to Toronto; and here we are
told "the platform was crowded with farmers anxious
to engage them all at once. It was difficult to get
them to the office." A gentleman arrived from Hamilton,
saying that sixty applications had been sent in
for boys, directly it was known that Miss Macpherson
was coming out. So there is no need of anticipating
anything like repugnance on the part of the Canadians
to the reception of our superfluous Arabs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>WAIFS AND STRAYS.</h3>


<p>Among the various qualifications for the festivities of
Christmastide and New Year, there is one which is,
perhaps, not so generally recognised as it might be.
Some of us are welcomed to the bright fireside or the
groaning table on the score of our social and conversational
qualities. At many and many a cheery
board, poverty is the only stipulation that is made. I
mean not now that the guests shall occupy the unenviable
position of "poor relations," but, in the large-hearted
charity that so widely prevails at that festive
season, the need of a dinner is being generally accepted
as a title to that staple requirement of existence.
Neither of these, however, is the distinction
required in order to entitle those who bear it to the
hospitality of Mr. Edward Wright, better known
under the abbreviated title of "Ned," and without
the prefatory "Mr." That one social quality, without
which a seat at Ned Wright's festive board cannot
be compassed, is Felony. A little rakish-looking
green ticket was circulated a few days previously
among the members of Mr. Wright's former fraternity,
bidding them to a "Great Supper" in St. John's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Chapel, Penrose Street (late West Street), Walworth,
got up under the auspices of the South-East London
Mission. The invitation ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This ticket is only available for a male person
who has been convicted at least once for felony, and
is not transferable. We purpose providing a good
supper of bread and soup, after which an address will
be given. At the close of the meeting a parcel of
provisions will be given to each man. Supper will be
provided in the lower part of the chapel. Boys not
admitted this time.&mdash;Your friend, for Christ's sake,</p>

<p class='right'>"<span class="smcap">Ned Wright</span>."</p></div>

<p>Why juvenile felons should be excluded "this
time," and whether the fact of having been convicted
more than once would confer any additional privileges,
did not appear at first sight. So it was, however;
adult felonious Walworth was bidden to the
supper, and to the supper it came. Among the
attractions held out to spectators of the proceedings
was the announcement that a magistrate was to take
part in them&mdash;a fact that possibly was not made
generally known among the guests, in whose regard
it is very questionable whether the presence of the
dreaded "beak" might not have proved the reverse of
a "draw." However, they came, possibly in happy
ignorance of the potentate who was awaiting them,
and than whom there is one only creation of civilized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
life considered by the London cadger his more natural
enemy, that is the policeman.</p>

<p>Six o'clock was the hour appointed for the repast,
and there was no need for the wanderer in Walworth
Road to inquire which was Penrose Street.
Little groups of shambling fellows hulked about the
corner waiting for some one to lead the way to the
unaccustomed chapel. Group after group, however,
melted away into the dingy building where Ned was
ready to welcome them. With him I found, not
one magistrate, but two; one the expected magnate
from the country, the other a well-known occupant of
the London bench, with whom, I fancy, many of the
guests could boast a previous acquaintance of a character
the reverse of desirable. Penrose Street Chapel
had been formerly occupied by the Unitarians, but
was then taken permanently by Ned Wright at a
rental of between 60<i>l.</i> and 70<i>l.</i> per annum, and formed
the third of his "centres," the others being under a
railway arch in the New Kent Road, and the Mission
Hall, Deptford. As row by row filled with squalid
occupants, I could but scan from my vantage-ground
in the gallery the various physiognomies. I am bound
to say the typical gaol-bird was but feebly represented.
The visitors looked like hard-working men&mdash;a little
pinched and hungry, perhaps, and in many cases
obviously dejected and ashamed of the qualification
which gave them their seat. One or two, mostly of
the younger, came in with a swagger and a rough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
joke; but Ned and his guests knew one another, and
he quickly removed the lively young gentleman to a
quiet corner out of harm's way. A fringe of spectators,
mostly female, occupied the front seat in the
gallery when proceedings commenced, which they did
with a hymn, composed by Ned Wright himself. The
ladies' voices proved very useful in this respect; but
most of the men took the printed copies of the hymns,
which were handed round, and looked as if they could
read them, not a few proving they could by singing
full-voiced. After the hymn, Wright announced that
he had ordered eighty gallons of soup&mdash;some facetious
gentleman suggesting, "That's about a gallon apiece"&mdash;and
he hoped all would get enough. Probably
about 100 guests had by this time assembled,
and each was provided with a white basin, which was
filled by Ned and his assistants, with soup from a
washing jug. A paper bag containing half a quartern
loaf was also given to each, and the contents rapidly
disappeared. As the fragrant steam mounted provokingly
from the soup-basins up to the gallery, Mr.
Wright took occasion to mention that at the last
supper Mr. Clark, of the New Cut, furnished the
soup gratuitously&mdash;a fact which he thought deserved
to be placed on record.</p>

<p>In the intervals of the banquet, the host informed
me that he had already witnessed forty genuine
"conversions" as the results of these gatherings. He
had, as usual, to contend with certain obtrusive gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tlemen
who "assumed the virtue" of felony, "though
they had it not," and were summarily dismissed with
the assurance that he "didn't want no tramps."
One mysterious young man came in and sat down on
a front row, but did not remain two minutes before a
thought seemed to strike him, and he beat a hasty
retreat. Whether he was possessed with the idea I
had to combat on a previous occasion of the same
kind, that I was a policeman, I cannot tell, but he
never reappeared. I hope I was not the innocent
cause of his losing his supper. The only "felonious"
trait I observed was a furtive glance every now and
then cast around, and especially up to the gallery.
Beyond this there really was little to distinguish the
gathering from a meeting of artisans a little bit
"down on their luck," or out on strike, or under
some cloud of that sort.</p>

<p>As supper progressed, the number of spectators in
the gallery increased; and, with all due deference to
Ned Wright's good intentions, it may be open to
question whether this presence of spectators in the
gallery is wise. It gives a sort of spurious dash and
bravado to the calling of a felon to be supping in
public, and have ladies looking on, just like the
"swells" at a public dinner. I am sure some of the
younger men felt this, and swaggered through their
supper accordingly. There certainly was not a symptom
of shame on the face of a single guest, or any
evidences of dejection, when once the pea-soup had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
done its work. Some of the very lively gentlemen
in the front row even devoted themselves to making
critical remarks on the occupants of the gallery. As
a rule, and considering the antecedents of the men,
the assembly was an orderly one; and would, I think,
have been more so, but for the presence of the fair
sex in the upper regions, many of whom, it is but
justice to say, were enjoying the small talk of certain
oily-haired young missionaries, and quite unconscious
of being the objects of admiring glances from below.</p>

<p>Supper took exactly an hour, and then came another
hymn, Ned Wright telling his guests that the tune
was somewhat difficult, but that the gallery would
sing it for them first, and then they would be able to
do it for themselves. Decidedly, Mr. Wright is
getting "&aelig;sthetic." This hymn was, in fact, monopolized
by the gallery, the men listening and evidently
occupied in digesting their supper. One would rather
have heard something in which they could join.
However, it was a lively march-tune, and they evidently
liked it, and kept time to it with their feet,
after the custom of the gods on Boxing Night. At
this point Ned and five others mounted the little
railed platform, Bible in hand, and the host read what
he termed "a portion out of the Good Old Book,"
choosing appropriately Luke xv., which tells of the
joy among angels over one sinner that repenteth, and
the exquisite allegory of the Prodigal Son, which Ned
read with a good deal of genuine pathos. It reminded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
him, he said, of old times. He himself was one of
the first prisoners at Wandsworth when "old Brixton"
was shut up. He had "done" three calendar months,
and when he came out he saw an old grey-headed
man, with a bundle. "That," said Ned, "was my
godly old father, and the bundle was new clothes in
place of my old rags."</p>

<p>The country magistrate then came forward, and
drew an ironical contrast between the "respectable"
people in the gallery and the "thieves" down below.
"God says we have all 'robbed Him.' All are equal
in God's sight. But some of us are pardoned thieves."
At this point the discourse became theological, and
fired over the heads of the people down below. They
listened much as they listen to a magisterial remark
from the bench; but it was not their own language,
such as Ned speaks. It was the "beak," not the old
"pal." It was not their vernacular. It did for the
gallery&mdash;interested the ladies and the missionaries
vastly, but not the thieves. It was wonderful that
they bore it as well as they did. The magisterial
dignity evidently overawed them; but they soon got
used to it, and yawned or sat listlessly. Some leant
their heads on the rail in front and slept. The latest
arrivals left earliest. They had come to supper, not
to sermon.</p>

<p>Another of Ned Wright's hymns was then sung&mdash;Mr.
Wright's muse having been apparently prolific in
the past year, no less than six hymns on the list<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
being written by himself during those twelve months.
It is much to be hoped that these poetical and
&aelig;sthetical proclivities will not deaden his practical
energies. This hymn was pitched distressingly high,
and above the powers of all but the "gallery" and a
very few indeed of the guests; but most of them put in
a final "Glory, Hallelujah," at the end of each stanza.
Mr. Wright's tunes are bright and cheerful in the extreme,
without being vulgar or offensively secular.</p>

<p>The host himself then spoke a few words on the
moral of the Sermon on the Mount: "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness." He
claimed many of those before him as old pals who had
"drunk out of the same pot and shuffled the same
pack of cards," and contrasted his present state with
theirs. Then they listened, open-mouthed and eager-eyed,
though they had been sitting two full hours.
He pictured the life of Christ, and His love for poor
men. "Christ died for you," he said, "as well as for
the 'big people.' Who is that on the cross beside
the Son of God?" he asked in an eloquent apostrophe.
"It is a thief. Come to Christ, and say, 'I've no
character. I'm branded as a felon. I'm hunted about
the streets of London. He will accept you.'" He
drew a vivid picture of the number of friends he had
when he rowed for Dogget's Coat and Badge. He
met with an accident midway; "and when I got to
the Swan at Chelsea," he said, "I had no friends left.
I was a losing man. Christ will never treat you like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that. He has never let me want in the nine years
since I have been converted." After a prayer the
assembly broke up, only those being requested to
remain who required advice. The prayer was characteristic,
being interspersed with groans from the
gallery; and then a paper bag, containing bread and
cakes, was given to each, Ned observing, "There, the
devil don't give you that. He gives you toke and
skilly." Being desired to go quietly, one gentleman
expressed a hope that there was no policeman; another
adding, "We don't want to get lagged." Ned
had to reassure them on my score once more, and
then nearly all disappeared&mdash;some ingenious guests
managing to get two and three bags by going out and
coming in again, until some one in the gallery meanly
peached!</p>

<p>Only some half-dozen out of the hundred remained,
and Ned Wright kneeling at one of the benches
prayed fervently, and entered into conversation with
them one by one. Two or three others dropped in,
and there was much praying and groaning, but evidently
much sincerity. And so with at least some
new impressions for good, some cheering hopeful words
to take them on in the New Year, those few waifs and
strays passed out into the darkness, to retain, let it
be hoped, some at least of the better influences which
were brought to bear upon them in that brighter
epoch in their darkened lives when Ned Wright's invitation
gathered them to the Thieves' Supper.</p>

<h3>A LUNATIC BALL.</h3>


<p>One half of the world believes the other half to be mad;
and who shall decide which moiety is right, the reputed
lunatics or the supposed sane, since neither
party can be unprejudiced in the matter? At present
the minority believe that it is a mere matter of
numbers, and that if intellect carried the day, and
right were not overborne by might, the position of
parties would be exactly reversed. The dilemma
forced itself strongly on my consciousness for a solution
when I attended the annual ball at Hanwell
Lunatic Asylum. The prevailing opinion inside the
walls was that the majority of madmen lay outside,
and that the most hopelessly insane people in all the
world were the officers immediately concerned in the
management of the establishment itself.</p>

<p>It was a damp, muggy January evening when I
journeyed to this suburban retreat. It rained dismally,
and the wind nearly blew the porter out of his
lodge as he obeyed our summons at the Dantesque
portal of the institution, in passing behind which so
many had literally abandoned hope. I tried to fancy
how it would feel if one were really being consigned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to that receptacle by interested relatives, as we read
in three-volume novels; but it was no use. I was
one of a merry company on that occasion. The
officials of Hanwell Asylum had been a little shy of
being handed down to fame; so I adopted the ruse
of getting into Herr Gustav K&uuml;ster's corps of fiddlers
for the occasion. However, I must in fairness add
that the committee during the evening withdrew the
taboo they had formerly placed on my writing. I
was free to immortalize them; and my fiddling was
thenceforth a work of supererogation.</p>

<p>High jinks commenced at the early hour of six; and
long before that time we had deposited our instruments
in the Bazaar, as the ball-room is somewhat incongruously
called, and were threading the D&aelig;dalean
mazes of the wards. Life in the wards struck me as
being very like living in a passage; but when that
preliminary objection was got over, the long corridors
looked comfortable enough. They were painted in
bright warm colours, and a correspondingly genial
temperature was secured by hot-water pipes running
the entire length. Comfortable rooms opened out
from the wards at frequent intervals, and there was
every form of amusement to beguile the otherwise
irksome leisure of those temporary recluses. Most of
my hermits were smoking&mdash;I mean on the male side&mdash;many
were reading; one had a fiddle, and I scraped
acquaintance immediately with him; whilst another
was seated at the door of his snug little bedroom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
getting up cadenzas on the flute. He was an old
trombone-player in one of the household regiments,
an inmate of Hanwell for thirty years, and a fellow-bandsman
with myself for the evening. He looked,
I thought, quite as sane as myself, and played magnificently;
but I was informed by the possibly
prejudiced officials that he had his occasional weaknesses.
A second member of Herr K&uuml;ster's band
whom I found in durance was a clarionet-player,
formerly in the band of the Second Life Guards; and
this poor fellow, who was an excellent musician too,
felt his position acutely. He apologized sotto voce
for sitting down with me in corduroys, as well as for
being an "imbecile." He did not seem to question
the justice of the verdict against him, and had not
become acclimatized to the atmosphere like the old
trombone-player.</p>

<p>That New Year's night&mdash;for January was very
young&mdash;the wards, especially on the women's side,
were gaily decorated with paper flowers, and all
looked as cheerful and happy as though no shadow
ever fell across the threshold; but, alas, there were
every now and then padded rooms opening out of the
passage; and as this was not a refractory ward, I
asked the meaning of the arrangement, which I had
fancied was an obsolete one. I was told they were
for epileptic patients. In virtue of his official position
as bandmaster, Herr K&uuml;ster had a key; and, after
walking serenely into a passage precisely like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rest, informed me, with the utmost coolness, that I
was in the refractory ward. I looked around for the
stalwart attendant, who is generally to be seen on
duty, and to my dismay found he was quite at the
other end of an exceedingly long corridor. I do not
know that I am particularly nervous; but I candidly
confess to an anxiety to get near that worthy official.
We were only three outsiders, and the company
looked mischievous. One gentleman was walking
violently up and down, turning up his coat-sleeves,
as though bent on our instant demolition. Another,
an old grey-bearded man, came up, and fiercely
demanded if I were a Freemason. I was afraid he
might resent my saying I was not, when it happily
occurred to me that the third in our party, an amateur
contra-bassist, was of the craft. I told our old friend
so. He demanded the sign, was satisfied, and, in the
twinkling of an eye, our double-bass friend was
struggling in his fraternal embrace. The warder,
mistaking the character of the hug, hastened to the
rescue, and I was at ease.</p>

<p>We then passed to the ball-room, where my musical
friends were beginning to "tune up," and waiting for
their conductor. The large room was gaily decorated,
and filled with some three or four hundred patients,
arranged Spurgeon-wise: the ladies on one side, and
the gentlemen on the other. There was a somewhat
rakish air about the gathering, due to the fact of the
male portion not being in full dress, but arrayed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
free-and-easy costume of corduroys and felt boots.
The frequent warders in their dark blue uniforms lent
quite a military air to the scene; and on the ladies'
side the costumes were more picturesque; some little
latitude was given to feminine taste, and the result was
that a large portion of the patients were gorgeous in
pink gowns. One old lady, who claimed to be a scion
of royalty, had a resplendent mob-cap; but the belles
of the ball-room were decidedly to be found among
the female attendants, who were bright, fresh-looking
young women, in a neat, black uniform, with perky
little caps, and bunches of keys hanging at their
side like the rosary of a s&oelig;ur de charit&eacute;, or the
chatelaines with which young ladies love to adorn
themselves at present. Files of patients kept
streaming into the already crowded room, and
one gentleman, reversing the order assigned to
him by nature, walked gravely in on the palms of
his hands, with his legs elevated in air. He had been
a clown at a theatre, and still retained some of the
proclivities of the boards. A wizen-faced man, who
seemed to have no name beyond the conventional one
of "Billy," strutted in with huge paper collars, like
the corner man in a nigger troupe, and a tin decoration
on his breast the size of a cheeseplate. He was
insensible to the charms of Terpsichore, except in the
shape of an occasional pas seul, and laboured under
the idea that his mission was to conduct the band,
which he occasionally did, to the discomfiture of Herr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
K&uuml;ster, and the total destruction of gravity on the
part of the executants, so that Billy had to be displaced.
It was quite curious to notice the effect of
the music on some of the quieter patients. One or
two, whose countenances really seemed to justify their
incarceration, absolutely hugged the foot of my music-stand,
and would not allow me to hold my instrument
for a moment when I was not playing on it, so
anxious were they to express their admiration of me
as an artist. "I used to play that instrument afore
I come here," said a patient, with a squeaky voice,
who for eleven years has laboured under the idea that
his mother is coming to see him on the morrow;
indeed, most of the little group around the platform
looked upon their temporary sojourn at Hanwell as
the only impediment to a bright career in the musical
world.</p>

<p>Proceedings commenced with the Caledonians, and
it was marvellous to notice the order, not to say grace
and refinement with which these pauper lunatics went
through their parts in the "mazy." The rosy-faced
attendants formed partners for the men, and I saw a
herculean warder gallantly leading along the stout old
lady in the mob-cap. The larger number of the
patients of course were paired with their fellow-prisoners,
and at the top of the room the officials
danced with some of the swells. Yes, there were
swells here, ball-room coxcombs in fustian and felt.
One in particular was pointed out to me as an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
University graduate of high family, and on my inquiring
how such a man became an inmate of a pauper
asylum the official said, "You see, sir, when the mind
goes the income often goes too, and the people become
virtually paupers." Insanity is a great leveller, true;
but I could not help picturing that man's lucid
intervals, and wondering whether his friends might
not do better for him. But there he is, pirouetting
away with the pretty female organist, the chaplain
standing by and smiling approval, and the young
doctors doing the polite to a few invited guests, but
not disdaining, every now and then, to take a turn
with a patient. Quadrilles and Lancers follow, but
no "round dances." A popular prejudice on the part
of the majority sets down such dances as too exciting
for the sensitive dancers. The graduate is excessively
irate at this, and rates the band soundly for not playing
a valse. Galops are played, but not danced; a
complicated movement termed a "Circassian circle"
being substituted in their place. "Three hours of
square dances are really too absurd," said the graduate
to an innocent second fiddle.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room all was gravity and
decorum, but the merriest dances went on in corners.
An Irish quadrille was played, and an unmistakable
Paddy regaled himself with a most beautiful jig. He
got on by himself for a figure or two, when, remembering,
no doubt, that "happiness was born a
twin," he dived into the throng, selected a white-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>headed
old friend of some sixty years, and impressed
him with the idea of a pas de deux. There they kept
it up in a corner for the whole of the quadrille,
twirling imaginary shillelaghs, and encouraging one
another with that expressive Irish interjection which
it is so impossible to put down on paper. For an
hour all went merry as the proverbial marriage bell,
and then there was an adjournment of the male
portion of the company to supper. The ladies remained
in the Bazaar and discussed oranges, with an
occasional dance to the pianoforte, as the band retired
for refreshment too, in one of the attendants' rooms.
I followed the company to their supper room, as I
had come to see, not to eat. About four hundred sat
down in a large apartment, and there were, besides,
sundry snug supper-parties in smaller rooms. Each
guest partook of an excellent repast of meat and
vegetables, with a sufficiency of beer and pipes to
follow. The chaplain said a short grace before
supper, and a patient, who must have been a retired
Methodist preacher, improved upon the brief benediction
by a long rambling "asking of a blessing,"
to which nobody paid any attention. Then I passed
up and down the long rows with a courteous official,
who gave me little snatches of the history of some of
the patients. Here was an actor of some note in
his day; there a barrister; here again a clergyman;
here a tradesman recently "gone," "all through the
strikes, sir," he added. The shadow&mdash;that most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
mysterious shadow of all&mdash;had chequered life's sunshine
in every one of these cases. Being as they are
they could not be in a better place. They have the
best advice they could get even were they&mdash;as some
of them claim to be&mdash;princes. If they can be cured,
here is the best chance. If not&mdash;well, there were
the little dead-house and the quiet cemetery lying
out in the moonlight, and waiting for them when, as
poor maddened Edgar Allen Poe wrote, the "fever
called living," should be "over at last." But who
talks of dying on this one night in all the year when
even that old freemason in the refractory ward was
forgetting, after his own peculiar fashion, the cruel
injustice that kept him out of his twelve thousand a
year and title? Universal merriment is the rule to-night.
Six or seven gentlemen are on their legs at
once making speeches, which are listened to about as
respectfully as the "toast of the evening" at a public
dinner. As many more are singing inharmoniously
different songs; the fun is getting fast and furious,
perhaps a little too fast and furious, when a readjournment
to the ball-room is proposed, and readily
acceded to, one hoary-headed old flirt remarking to
me as he went by, that he was going to look for his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>A long series of square dances followed, the graduate
waxing more and more fierce at each disappointment
in his anticipated valse, and Billy giving
out every change in the programme like a parish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
clerk, which functionary he resembled in many
respects. It was universally agreed that this was the
best party that had ever been held in the asylum,
just as the last baby is always the finest in the
family. Certainly the guests all enjoyed themselves.
The stalwart attendants danced more than ever with
a will, the rosy attendants were rosier and nattier
than before, if possible. The mob-cap went whizzing
about on the regal head of its owner down the middle
of tremendous country dances, hands across, set to
partners, and then down again as though it had never
tasted the anxieties of a throne, or learnt by bitter
experience the sorrows of exile. Even the academical
gentleman relaxed to the fair organist, though he
stuck up his hair stiffer than ever, and stamped his
felt boots again as he passed the unoffending double-bass
with curses both loud and deep on the subject
of square dances. At length came the inevitable
"God Save the Queen," which was played in one key
by the orchestra, and sung in a great many different
ones by the guests. It is no disrespect to Her Majesty
to say that the National Anthem was received
with anything but satisfaction. It was the signal
that the "jinks" were over, and that was quite enough
to make it unpopular. However, they sang lustily
and with a good courage, all except the old woman
in the mob-cap, who sat with a complacent smile as
much as to say, "This is as it should be, I appreciate
the honour done to my royal brothers and sisters."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the bright side of the picture; but it had its
sombre tints also. There were those in all the wards
who stood aloof from the merriment, and would have
none of the jinks. Lean-visaged men walked moodily
up and down the passages like caged wild beasts.
Their lucid interval was upon them, and they fretted
at the irksome restraint and degrading companionship.
It was a strange thought; but I fancied they
must have longed for their mad fit as the drunkard
longs for the intoxicating draught, or the opium-eater
for his delicious narcotic to drown the idea of
the present. There were those in the ball-room itself
who, if you approached them with the proffered pinch
of snuff, drove you from them with curses. One fine,
intellectual man, sat by the window all the evening,
writing rhapsodies of the most extraordinary character,
and fancying himself a poet. Another wrapped
round a thin piece of lath with paper, and superscribed
it with some strange hieroglyphics, begging
me to deliver it. All made arrangements for their
speedy departure from Hanwell, though many in
that heart-sick tone which spoke of long-deferred
hope&mdash;hope never perhaps to be realized. Most
painful sight of all, there was one little girl there,
a child of eleven or twelve years&mdash;a child in a
lunatic asylum! Think of that, parents, when you
listen to the engaging nonsense of your little ones&mdash;think
of the child in Hanwell wards! Remember
how narrow a line separates innocence from idiocy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
so narrow a line that the words were once synonymous!</p>

<p>Then there was the infirmary full of occupants on
that merry New Year's night. Yonder poor patient
being wheeled in a chair to bed will not trouble his
attendant long. There is another being lifted on his
pallet-bed, and having a cup of cooling drink applied
to his parched lips by the great loving hands of a
warder who tends him as gently as a woman. It
seemed almost a cruel kindness to be trying to keep
that poor body and soul together.</p>

<p>Another hour, rapidly passed in the liberal hospitality
of this great institution, and silence had fallen
on its congregated thousands. It is a small town in
itself, and to a large extent self-dependent and self-governed.
It bakes and brews, and makes its gas;
and there is no need of a Licensing Bill to keep its
inhabitants sober and steady. The method of doing
that has been discovered in nature's own law of kindness.
Instead of being chained and treated as wild
beasts, the lunatics are treated as unfortunate men
and women, and every effort is made to ameliorate,
both physically and morally, their sad condition.
Hence the bright wards, the buxom attendants, the
frequent jinks. Even the chapel-service has been
brightened up for their behoof.</p>

<p>This was what I saw by entering as an amateur
fiddler Herr K&uuml;ster's band at Hanwell Asylum; and
as I ran to catch the last up-train&mdash;which I did as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the saying is by the skin of my teeth&mdash;I felt that I
was a wiser, though it may be a sadder man, for my
evening's experiences at the Lunatic Ball.</p>

<p>One question would keep recurring to my mind.
It has been said that if you stop your ears in a ball-room,
and then look at the people&mdash;reputed sane&mdash;skipping
about in the new valse or the last galop,
you will imagine they must be all lunatics. I did
not stop my ears that night, but I opened my eyes
and saw hundreds of my fellow-creatures, all with
some strange delusions, many with ferocious and
vicious propensities, yet all kept in order by a few
warders, a handful of girls, and all behaving as decorously
as in a real ball-room. And the question
which <i>would</i> haunt me all the way home was, which
are the sane people, and which the lunatics?</p>

<h3>A BABY SHOW.</h3>


<p>There is no doubt that at the present moment the
British baby is assuming a position amongst us of
unusual prominence and importance. That he should
be an institution is inevitable. That he grows upon
us Londoners at the rate of some steady five hundred
a week, the Registrar-General's statistics of the excess
of births over deaths prove beyond question. His
domestic importance and powers of revolutionizing
a household are facts of which every Paterfamilias is
made, from time to time, unpleasantly aware. But
the British baby is doing more than this just at
present. He is assuming a public position. Perhaps
it is only the faint index of the extension of women's
rights to the infantile condition of the sexes. Possibly
our age is destined to hear of Baby Suffrage,
Baby's Property Protection, Baby's Rights and
Wrongs in general. It is beyond question that the
British baby <i>is</i> putting itself forward, and demanding
to be heard&mdash;as, in fact, it always had a habit of
doing. Its name has been unpleasantly mixed up
with certain revelations at Brixton, Camberwell, and
Greenwich. Babies have come to be farmed like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
taxes or turnpike gates. The arable infants seem to
gravitate towards the transpontine districts south of
the Thames. It will be an interesting task for our
Legislature to ascertain whether there is any actual
law to account for the transfer, as it inevitably will
have to do when the delicate choice is forced upon it
between justifiable infanticide, wholesale Hospices des
Enfants Trouv&eacute;s, and possibly some kind of Japanese
"happy despatch" for high-minded infants who are
superior to the slow poison administered by injudicious
"farmers." At all events, one fact is certain,
and we can scarcely reiterate it too often&mdash;the British
baby is becoming emphatic beyond anything we can
recollect as appertaining to the infantile days of the
present generation. It is as though a ray of juvenile
"swellishness," a scintillation of hobbledehoyhood,
were refracted upon the long clothes or three-quarter
clothes of immaturity.</p>

<p>For, if it is true&mdash;as we may tax our infantile experiences
to assure us&mdash;that "farmed" infants were an
article unknown to husbandry in our golden age, it is
equally certain that the idea of the modern Baby
Show was one which, in that remote era, would not
have been tolerated. Our mothers and grandmothers
would as soon have thought of sacrificing an innocent
to Moloch as to Mammon. What meant it then&mdash;to
what can it be due&mdash;to precocity on the part of the
British baby, or degeneracy on the part of the British
parent&mdash;that two Baby Shows were "on" nearly at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
same moment&mdash;one at Mr. Giovannelli's at Highbury
Barn, the other at Mr. Holland's Gardens, North
Woolwich?</p>

<p>Anxious to keep au courant with the times, even
when those times are chronicled by the rapid career of
the British baby&mdash;anxious also to blot out the idea of
the poor emaciated infants of Brixton, Camberwell,
and Greenwich, by bringing home to my experience
the opposite pole of infantile development&mdash;I paid a
visit, and sixpence, at Highbury Barn when the Baby
Show opened. On entering Mr. Giovannelli's spacious
hall, consecrated on ordinary occasions to the Terpsichorean
art, I found it a veritable shrine of the "Diva
triformis." Immediately on entering I was solicited
to invest extra coppers in a correct card, containing
the names, weights, and&mdash;not colours; they were all
of one colour, that of the ordinary human lobster&mdash;but
weights, of the various forms of Wackford Squeers
under twelve months, who were then and there assembled,
like a lot of little fat porkers. It was, in
truth, a sight to whet the appetite of an "annexed"
Fiji Islander, or any other carnivorous animal. My
correct card specified eighty "entries;" but, although
the exhibition only opened at two o'clock, and I was
there within an hour after, I found the numbers up
to 100 quite full. The interesting juveniles were
arranged within rails, draped with pink calico, all
arrayed in "gorgeous attire," and most of them partaking
of maternal sustenance. The mammas&mdash;all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
respectable married women of the working class&mdash;seemed
to consider the exhibition of their offspring
by no means infra dig., and were rather pleased than
otherwise to show you the legs and other points of
their adipose encumbrances. Several proposed that I
should test the weight, which I did tremulously, and
felt relieved when the infant Hercules was restored to
its natural protector. The prizes, which amounted in
the gross to between two and three hundred pounds,
were to be awarded in sums of 10<i>l.</i> and 5<i>l.</i>, and sometimes
in the shape of silver cups, on what principle I
am not quite clear; but the decision was to rest with
a jury of three medical men and two "matrons." If
simple adiposity, or the approximation of the human
form divine to that of the hippopotamus, be the standard
of excellence, there could be no doubt that a
young gentleman named Thomas Chaloner, numbered
48 in the correct card, aged eight months, and weighing
33lbs., would be facile princeps, a prognostication
of mine subsequently justified by the event. I must
confess to looking with awe, and returning every now
and then to look again, on this colossal child. At my
last visit some one asked on what it had been fed.
Shall I own that the demon of mischief prompted me
to supplement the inquiry by adding, "Oil cake, <i>or</i>
Thorley's Food for Cattle?"</p>

<p>On the score, I suppose, of mere peculiarity, my
own attention&mdash;I frankly confess I am not a connoisseur&mdash;was
considerably engrossed by "two little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Niggers." No doubt the number afterwards swelled
to the orthodox "ten little Niggers." One was a
jovial young "cuss" of eleven months&mdash;weighted at
29lbs., and numbered 62 on the card. He was a
clean-limbed young fellow, with a head of hair like a
furze-bush, and his mother was quite untinted. I
presume Paterfamilias was a fine coloured gentleman.
The other representative of the sons of Ham&mdash;John
Charles Abdula, aged three months, weight 21lbs.,
and numbered 76&mdash;was too immature to draw upon
my sympathies; since I freely acknowledge such
specimens are utterly devoid of interest for me until
their bones are of sufficient consistency to enable them
to sit upright and look about as a British baby should.
This particular infant had not an idea above culinary
considerations. He was a very Alderman in embryo,
if there are such things as coloured Aldermen. Then
there were twins&mdash;that inscrutable visitation of Providence&mdash;three
brace of gemini. Triplets, in mercy
to our paternal feelings, Mr. Giovannelli spared us.</p>

<p>There was one noteworthy point about this particular
exhibition. The mothers, at all events, got a
good four days' feed whilst their infantile furniture
was "on view." I heard, sotto voce, encomiums
on the dinner of the day confidingly exchanged between
gushing young matrons, and I myself witnessed
the disappearance of a decidedly comfortable tea, to
say nothing of sundry pints of porter discussed sub
ros&acirc; and free of expense to such as stood in need of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
sustenance; and indeed a good many seemed to stand
in need of it. Small wonder, when the mammas were
so forcibly reminded by the highly-developed British
baby that, in Byron's own words, "our life is twofold."</p>

<p>It is certainly passing, not from the sublime to the
ridiculous, but vice vers&acirc;, yet it is noting another testimony
to the growing importance of the British baby,
if one mentions the growth of cr&egrave;ches, or day-nurseries
for working-men's children in the metropolis. Already
an institution in Paris, they have been recently introduced
into England, and must surely prove a boon
to the wives of our working men. What in the world
does become of the infants of poor women who are
forced to work all day for their maintenance? Is it not
a miracle if something almost worse than "farming"&mdash;death
from negligence, fire, or bad nursing&mdash;does
not occur to them? The good ladies who have
founded, and themselves work, these cr&egrave;ches are surely
meeting a confessed necessity. I paid a visit one
day to 4, Bulstrode Street, where one of these
useful institutions was in full work. I found forty
little toddlers, some playing about a comfortable day-nursery,
others sleeping in tiny cribs ranged in a
double line along a spacious, well-aired sleeping-room;
some, too young for this, rocked in cosy cradles; but
all clean, safe, and happy. What needs it to say
whether the good ladies who tended them wore the
habit of St. Vincent de Paul, the poke-bonnet of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Puseyite "sister," or the simple garb of unpretending
Protestantism? The thing is being done. The most
helpless of all our population&mdash;the children of the
working poor&mdash;are being kept from the streets, kept
from harm, and trained up to habits of decency, at
4, Bulstrode Street, Marylebone Lane. Any one can go
and see it for himself; and if he does&mdash;if he sees, as I
did, the quiet, unostentatious work that is there being
done for the British baby, "all for love and nothing
for reward"&mdash;I shall be very much surprised if he does
not confess that it is one of the best antidotes
imaginable to baby-farming, and a sight more decorous
and dignified than any Baby Show that could possibly
be imagined.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT IN A BAKEHOUSE.</h3>


<p>Alarmed at the prospect of "a free breakfast table"
in a sense other than the ordinary one&mdash;that is, a
breakfast table which should be minus the necessary
accompaniment of bread, or the luxury of French
rolls&mdash;I resolved to make myself master, so far as
might be possible, of the pros and cons of the question
at issue between bakers and masters at the period of
the anticipated strike some years ago. I confess to
having greatly neglected the subject of strikes. I had
attended a few meetings of the building operatives;
but the subject was one in which I myself was not
personally interested. I am not likely to want to
build a house, and might manage my own little
repairs while the strike lasted. But I confess to a
leaning for the staff of life. There are sundry small
mouths around me, too, of quite disproportionate
capacities in the way of bread and butter, to say
nothing at all of biscuits, buns, and tartlets. The
possibility of having to provide for an impending
state of siege, then, was one that touched me immediately
and vitally. Should I, before the dreaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
event, initiate the wife of my bosom in the mysteries
of bread baking? Should I commence forthwith a
series of practical experiments within the limited
confines of my kitchen oven? To prevent the otherwise
inevitable heaviness and possible ropiness in my
loaves of the future, some such previous process would
certainly have to be adopted. But, then, in order to
calculate the probabilities of the crisis, an examination
of the status in quo was necessary. Having a habit of
going to head-quarters in such questions, I resolved
to do so on the present occasion; so I took my hat,
and, as Sam Slick says, "I off an' out."</p>

<p>The actual head-quarters of the men I found to be
at the Pewter Platter, White Lion Street, Bishopsgate.
Thither I adjourned, and, after drinking the
conventional glass of bitter at the bar, asked for a
baker. One came forth from an inner chamber,
looking sleepy, as bakers always look. In the penetralia
of the parlour which he left I saw a group of
floury comrades, the prominent features of the
gathering being depression and bagatelle. By my
comatose friend I was referred to the Admiral Carter,
in Bartholomew Close, where the men's committee
sat daily at four. The society in front of the bar
there was much more cheerful than that of the
Pewter Platter, and the bakers were discussing much
beer, of which they hospitably invited me to partake.
Still I learned little of their movements, save that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
they were to a man resolved to abide by the now
familiar platform of work from four to four, higher
wages, and no Sunday bakings. These were the
principal features of the demands, the sack money
and perquisites being confessedly subsidiary. Nauseated
as the public was and is with strikes, there are
certain classes of the community with whom it is
disposed to sympathize; and certainly one of those
classes is that of journeymen bakers. Bread for
breakfast we must have, and rolls we should like; but
we should also like to have these commodities with as
little nightwork as possible on the part of those who
produce them. The "Appeal to the Public" put
forth by the Strike Committee on the evening of the
day concerning which I write was, perhaps, a trifle
sensational; but if there was any truth in it, such
a state of things demanded careful investigation&mdash;especially
if it was a fact that the baker slept upon
the board where the bread was made, and mingled
his sweat and tears with the ingredients of the staff
of life. Pardonably, I hope, I wished to eat bread
without baker for my breakfast; but how could I
probe this dreadful problem? I had it&mdash;by a visit to
the bakehouse of my own baker, if possible, during
the hours of work.</p>

<p>So I set out afresh after supper, and was most
obligingly received by the proprietor of what one may
well take as a typical West-end shop&mdash;neither very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
large nor very small&mdash;what is graphically termed a
"snug" concern with a good connexion, doing, as the
technical phrase goes, from sixteen to twenty sacks a
week. The resources of this establishment were at
once placed at my disposal for the night. Now, the
advantage of conferring with this particular master
was, that he was not pig-headed on the one hand, nor
unduly concessive, as he deemed some of his fellow-tradesmen
to be, on the other. He did not consider a
journeyman baker's berth a bed of roses, or his remuneration
likely to make him a millionaire; but neither
did he lose sight of the fact that certain hours must
be devoted to work, and a limit somewhere placed to
wage, or the public must suffer through the employer
of labour by being forced to pay higher prices. The
staff of this particular establishment consisted of four
men at the following wages: A foreman at 28<i>s.</i> and a
second hand at 20<i>s.</i> a week, both of whom were outsiders;
while, sleeping on the premises, and, at the
time of my arrival, buried in the arms of Morpheus,
were a third hand, at 16<i>s.</i>, and a fourth, at 12<i>s.</i>
Besides these wages they had certain perquisites, such
as bread, butter, sugar, flour, sack-money, yeast-money,
&amp;c.; and the master, moreover, took his
adequate share of day-work. He was seated outside
his shop, enjoying the cool breezes, not of evening,
but of midnight, when I presented myself before his
astonished gaze. His wife and children had long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
since retired. The foreman and second "hand" had
not arrived; the third and fourth "hands" were, as I
said, sweetly sleeping, in a chamber on the basement,
well out of range of the bakehouse, to which, like a
couple of conspirators, we descended. It was not
exactly the spot one would have selected for a permanent
residence if left free to choose. It was,
perhaps, as Mr. Dickens's theatrical gentleman
phrased it, pernicious snug; but the ventilation was
satisfactory. There were two ovens, which certainly
kept the place at a temperature higher than might
have been agreeable on that hot September night.
Kneading troughs were ranged round the walls, and
in the centre, like an altar-tomb, was the fatal "board"
where, however, I sought in vain for the traces of
perspiration or tears. All was scrupulously clean. In
common phrase, you might have "eaten your dinner"
off any portion of it.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight the outsiders turned in, first
the second hand and then the foreman, and, plunging
into the "Black Hole," made their toilettes du soir.
Then active operations commenced forthwith. In
one compartment of the kneading-trough was the
"sponge," which had been prepared by the foreman
early in the evening, and which now, having properly
settled, was mixed with the flour for the first batch,
and left to "prove." The process of making the
dough occupied until about one o'clock, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
followed two hours of comparative tranquillity, during
which the men adjourned to the retirement of certain
millers' sacks hard by, which they rolled up
cleverly into extempore beds, and seemed to prefer
to the board. The proving takes about two hours,
but varies with the temperature. If the dough is left
too long, a sour batch, or a "pitch in," is the result.
It is then cut out, weighed, and "handed up;" after
which it stands while the dough for the second batch
is being made, and those fatal rolls, around which so
much of this contest is likely to turn, are being got
forward. It must be understood that I am here
describing what took place in my typical bakehouse.
Proceedings will of course vary in details according
to the neighbourhood, the season, and other
circumstances. This makes, as my informant
suggested, the race of bakers necessarily in some
degree a varium atque mutabile genus, whom it
is difficult to bind by rigid "hard and fast"
lines. The first batch is in the oven at four, and is
drawn about 5.30. During the intervals there has
been the preparation of fancy bread and the "getting
off" of the rolls. Then the "cottage" batch is
moulded and got off, and comes out of the oven at
eight. From three o'clock up to this hour there has
been active work enough for everybody, and I felt
myself considerably in the way, adjourning ever and
anon to the master's snuggery above stairs to note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
down my experiences. As for the men, they must
have fancied that I was an escaped lunatic, with
harmless eccentricities; and the fourth hand, who
was young, gazed at me all night with a fixed and
sleepy glare, as though on his guard lest I should be
seized with a refractory fit. At eight the close atmosphere
of the bakehouse was exchanged for the fresh
morning breeze by three out of the four hands, who
went to deliver the bread. The foreman remained
with the master to work at "small goods" until
about one, when he prepares the ferment for the
next night's baking. All concerned can get their
operations over about one or half-past one; so that,
reckoning them to begin at half-past twelve, and
deducting two hours of "sweat and tears" from one
to three, when they can sleep if they will, there are
some eleven hours of active labour. After the delivery
of the bread is over, it should be mentioned,
each man has about half an hour's bakehouse work in
the way of getting coals, cleaning biscuit tins, brushing
up, &amp;c. When this is done, all, with the exception
of the foreman, who will have to look in and make
the sponge at eight <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, are free until the commencement
of their most untimely work at midnight.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the work in this particular bakehouse
is comparatively nil. The ovens have to be started
on Sunday morning; but this the master does himself,
and puts in the ferment, so that there is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the sponge to be made in the evening&mdash;a brief hour's
job, taken on alternate Sundays by the foreman and
the second hand. The "undersellers," my informant
told me, made large sums by Sunday bakings, often
covering their rent by them, so that their abandonment
would be a serious question; but there was
little in the way of Sabbath-breaking in my typical
bakehouse. As there were no Sunday bakings,
Saturday was a rather harder day than others, there
being a general scrub-up of the premises. The
work, my informant thought, could be condensed by
judicious co-operation, and the "four to four" rule
might be adopted in some establishments, but by no
means in all&mdash;as, for instance, where there was a
speciality for rolls and fancy bread. It seems, as
usual, that the difficulties thicken, not about the
necessaries, but about the luxuries and kickshaws of
life. The master relieved my immediate fears by
saying that he scarcely imagined matters would come
to a crisis. There was this difference between the
building and the baking trades, that all the master
bakers had been journeymen themselves, and were
thus able to sympathize with the men's difficulties.
They were not, he seemed to think, disposed to
haggle over a few shillings; but he added, "This is
not a question of labour against capital only, but of
labour against capital plus labour. I could," he said,
"if my men left me on the 21st, make bread enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
myself to supply all my customers, only they would
have to fetch it for themselves."</p>

<p>Thus my worst fears were relieved. If it only
came to going out for my loaf, and even foregoing
French rolls, I could face that like a man; so I paced
the streets gaily in the morning air and arrived home
safely some time after the milk, and about the same
hour as those rolls themselves whose hitherto unguessed
history I had so far fathomed by my brief
experiences in the bakehouse.</p>

<h3>A LONDON SLAVE MARKET.</h3>


<p>There is a story called "Travellers' Wonders" in that
volume which used to be the delight of our childhood,
when the rising generation was more easily amused
and not quite so wide-awake as at present. The point
of the narrative is, that a facetious old gentleman
named Captain Compass beguiles a group of juveniles&mdash;who
must have been singularly gullible even
for those early days&mdash;by describing in mysterious and
alien-sounding terms the commonest home objects,
such as coals, cheese, butter, and so on. It would
almost seem as though Hood must have been perpetrating
a kindred joke upon grown-up children when
he wrote the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's O to be a slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along with the barbarous Turk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where woman has never a soul to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If this is Christian Work!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Was he aware that here, in the heart of Christian
London, without going farther east than Bethnal
Green, there had existed from time immemorial, as
there exists still, a genuine Slave Market? Such
there is, and actually so named; less romantic, indeed,
than that we read of in "Don Juan," or used to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
see on the Adelphi boards in the drama of the
"Octoroon"&mdash;but still interesting in its way to those
who have a penchant for that grotesque side of London
life where the sublime and the ridiculous sometimes
blend so curiously.</p>

<p>With only the vague address of Bethnal Green and
the date of Tuesday morning to guide me, I set out
for Worship Street Police Court, thinking it possible
to gain some further particulars from the police. I
found those functionaries civil, indeed, but disposed to
observe even more than official reticence about the
Slave Market. They told me the locality precisely
enough, but were even more vague as to the hour
than my own impressions. In fact, the sum of what
I could gain from them was, in slightly Hibernian
language, that there was nothing to see, and I could
see it any time on a Tuesday morning when I chose
to go down White Street, Bethnal Green. Leaving
the Court and inquiring my route to White Street, I
found that it ran off to the right some way down the
Bethnal Green Road from Shoreditch Station. Having
turned out of the main thoroughfare, you proceed
down one of those characteristic East End streets
where every small householder lives behind an elaborate
bright green door with portentous knocker, going
on until an arch of the Great Eastern Railway spans
the road. Arriving at this point any time between
the hours of eight and half-past nine on a Monday or
Tuesday morning, you have no need to be told that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
this is the East London Slave Market&mdash;supposing
you knew such a thing as a slave market was to be
seen in East London at all.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, nothing resembling Byron's
graphic description in "Don Juan." Our English
slaves were all apparently of one nation, and there
were no slave merchants. The hundred young ladies
and gentlemen, of all ages from seven to seventeen,
were, as they would have expressed it, "on their own
hook." Ranged under the dead brick wall of the
railway arch, there was a generally mouldy appearance
about them. Instead of a picturesque difference
of colour, there was on every visage simply a greater
or less degree of that peculiar neutral tint, the unmistakable
unlovely hue of London dirt. In this respect,
too, they differed from the fresh country lads
and lasses one sees at a hiring in the North. They
were simply male and female City Arabs, with that
superabundant power of combining business and pleasure
which characterizes their race. The young gentlemen,
in the intervals of business&mdash;and it seemed to
be all interval and no business&mdash;devoted themselves
to games at buttons. Each of the young ladies&mdash;I
am afraid to say <i>how</i> young&mdash;had her cavalier, and
applied herself to very pronounced flirtation. The
language of one and all certainly fulfilled the baptismal
promise of their sponsors, if the poor little
waifs ever had any&mdash;for it was very "vulgar tongue"
indeed; and there was lots of it. The great sensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the morning was a broken window in an unoffending
tradesman's shop&mdash;a far from unusual occurrence,
as I learnt from the sufferer. This led to a slave
hunt on the part of the single policeman who occasionally
showed himself to keep as quiet as might be
the seething mass of humanity; and the young lady
or gentleman who was guilty of the damage was "off
market" for the morning&mdash;while the suffering tradesman
was assailed with a volley of abuse, couched in
strongest Saxon, for meekly protesting against the
demolition of his window-pane.</p>

<p>The scene was most characteristic&mdash;very unlike the
genteel West End Servants' Registry, where young
ladies and gentlemen's gentlemen saunter in to find
places with high wages and the work "put out." It
was on Tuesday morning, and a little late in the day,
that I timed my visit; and I was informed that the
Market was somewhat flat. Certainly, one could not
apply to it the technicalities of the Stock Exchange,
and say that little boys were "dull," or girls, big or
little, "inactive;" but early on a Monday morning is,
it appears, the time to see the Slave Market in full
swing. Strangely enough, so far as I could judge, it
was all slaves and no buyers&mdash;or, rather, hirers. I
did not see the symptom of a bargain being struck,
though I was informed that a good many small tradesmen
do patronize the Market, for shop-boys, nurse-girls,
or household drudges. I do not know whether
my appearance was particularly attractive; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
number of offers I received from domestics of all kinds
would have sufficed to stock half-a-dozen establishments.
"Want a boy, sir?" "A girl for the childer,
sir?" said the juveniles, while the offers of the adult
ladies were more emphatic and less quotable. All, of
course, was mere badinage, or, as they would have
called it, "chaff," and it was meant good-humouredly
enough; though, had I been a legitimate hirer, I do
not know that I should have been tempted to add to
my household from this source. Indeed, there were
some not exactly pleasant reflections cast on the Slave
Market by those whom I consulted as to its merits.
It was not unusual, I was told, for slaves who were
hired on a Monday to turn up again on Tuesday
morning, either from incompatibility of temper on the
part of domestic and superior, or from other causes
unexplained. Tuesday morning is, in fact, to a large
extent, the mere residuum either of Monday's unhired
incapables, or of "returns." And yet, as I looked
around, I saw&mdash;as where does one not see?&mdash;some fair
young faces; girls who might have played with one's
little children all the better because they were so
nearly children themselves; and boys of preternatural
quickness, up to any job, and capable of being useful&mdash;ay,
and even ornamental&mdash;members of society, if
only that dreadful Bethnal Green twang could have
been eradicated. The abuse of the mother tongue on
the part even of these children was simply frightful.
If this were so in their playful moods, what&mdash;one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
could not help thinking&mdash;would it be if any dispute
arose on a contested point of domestic economy: as,
for instance, the too rapid disappearance of the cold
mutton, or sudden absence of master's boots?</p>

<p>There was a garrulous cobbler whose stall bordered
on the Market, and his panacea for all the evils the
Slave Market brought with it was the London School
Board. "Why don't the officers come down and
collar some o' them youngsters, sir?" Why, indeed?
At present the Slave Market is undoubtedly a
nuisance; but there is no reason why, under proper
police supervision, it should not become a local convenience.
The ways of East London differ in all
respects from those of the West, and Servants' Registries
would not pay. Masters and servants are alike
too poor to advertise; and there seems to be no reason
why the Slave Market, under a changed name, and
with improved regulations, may not as really supply
a want as the country "hirings" do. The Arab, at
present, is not to be trusted with too much liberty.
Both male and female have odd Bedouin ways of their
own, requiring considerable and judicious manipulation
to mould them to the customs of civilized society.
The respectable residents, tired of the existing state
of things, look not unreasonably, as ratepayers, to the
School Board to thin down the children, and the
police to keep the adults in order. Under such conditions,
the Bethnal Green Slave Market may yet
become a useful institution.</p>

<h3>TEA AND EXPERIENCE.</h3>


<p>I was walking the other day in one of the pleasant
western suburbs, and rashly sought a short cut back;
when, as is generally the case, I found that the longer
would have been much the nearer way home. Before
I knew it, I was involved in the labyrinths of that
region, sacred to washerwomen and kindred spirits,
known as Kensal New Town; and my further progress
was barred by the intervention of the Paddington
Canal, which is spanned at rare intervals in
this locality by pay-bridges, to the great discomfort of
the often impecunious natives. There was not even
one of these at hand, or my halfpenny would have
been paid under protest; so I had to wander like a
lost sprite among the network of semi-genteel streets
that skirt that most ungenteel thoroughfare, the
Kensal New Town Road, and forthwith I began to
find the neighbourhood papered with placards, announcing
a "Tea and Experience Meeting" at a local
hall, under the presidency of the Free Church pastor,
for the following Monday evening. Bakers' shops
bristled with the handbills, and they studded the multitudinous
pork butchers' windows in juxtaposition with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cruel-looking black puddings and over-fat loin chops.
I determined I would go, if not to the tea, certainly
to the "Experience," for I like novel experiences of
all kinds: and this would certainly be new, whether
edifying or not.</p>

<p>I got at length out of the labyrinth, and on the following
Monday ventured once more within its mazes,
though not exactly at six o'clock, which was the hour
appointed for the preliminary experience of tea. I
had experienced that kind of thing once or twice
before, and never found myself in a position of such
difficulty as on those occasions. In the first place I
do not care about tea, when it is good; but loathe it
when boiled in a washhouse copper, and poured out
from a large tin can, of which it tastes unpleasantly.
But, then again, the quantity as well as the quality
of the viands to be consumed was literally too much
for me. I might have managed one cup of decidedly
nasty tea, or what passes muster for such, but not
four or five, which I found to be the minimum. I
could stomach, or secretly dispose of in my pockets, a
single slice of leaden cake or oleaginous bread-and-butter;
but I could not do this with multitudinous
slabs of either. I never went to more than one tea-meeting
where I felt at home, and that was at the Soir&eacute;e
Suisse, which takes place annually in London, where
pretty Helvetian damsels brew the most fragrant
coffee and hand round delicious little cakes, arrayed
as they are in their killing national costume and chat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>tering
in a dozen different patois. I had a notion that
tea at Kensal New Town would be very much less
eligible, so I stopped away. Perhaps I was prejudiced.
The tea might have been different from what I expected.
The experiences certainly were.</p>

<p>I got there about half-past seven, having allowed
an interval of an hour and a half, which I thought
would be sufficient for the most inveterate tea-drinker,
even among the Kensal Town laundresses, should such
happen to be present. I took the precaution,
however, of bespeaking a lad of fifteen to accompany
me, in case any of the fragments of the feast should
yet have to be disposed of, since I knew his powers to
equal those of the ostrich in stowing away eatables,
especially in the lumpy cake line. Arrived at the
hall, however, I found no symptoms of the tea save
a steamy sort of smell and the rattle of the retreating
cups and saucers. Whether "to my spirit's gain or
loss," I had escaped the banquet and yet got in good
time for the subsequent experiences.</p>

<p>A motherly-looking woman stood at the door, and
gave me a cheery invitation to come in. She looked
rather askance at my boy, but finding him properly
convoyed by my sober self, she admitted him within
the portal. A good many young gentlemen of a
similar age were evidently excluded, and were regaling
themselves with pagan sports outside. The hall was
partially filled with respectable-looking mechanics,
their wives, and families, there being more wives than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mechanics, and more families than either. Children
abounded, especially babies in every stage of infantile
development. Many were taking their maternal tea;
and the boys and girls were got up in the most festive
attire, the boys particularly shining with yellow soap.
Most of the mammas wore perky hats, and many had
follow-me-lads down the back, but all were exceedingly
well-dressed and well-behaved, though evidently
brimful of hilarity as well as cake and tea.</p>

<p>At the end of the hall was the inevitable platform,
with chairs and a large cushion spread over the front
rail for convenience of praying; since the "experiences"
were to be interspersed with sacred song and
prayer. Two gentlemen&mdash;I use the term advisedly&mdash;mounted
the rostrum, one a long-bearded, middle-aged
man, in a frock coat, who was the pastor, and
another an aged minister, superannuated, as I afterwards
discovered, and not altogether happy in his
worldly lot. He was very old, grey-haired, and
feeble, with a worn suit of clerical black, and a
voluminous white tie. He sat humbly, almost
despondingly, by the side of his younger brother in
the ministry, while the latter delivered a merry little
opening address, hoping all had made a good tea; if
not, there was still about half a can left. Nobody
wanted any more; so they had a hymn from the
"Sacred Songster," a copy of which volume I purchased
in the hall for twopence halfpenny. The tune
was a martial one, well sung by a choir of men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
women to the accompaniment of a harmonium, and
bravely borne part in, you may depend upon it, by the
whole assembly, I verily believe, except the babies,
and one or two of these put in a note sometimes.
The hymn was called, "Oh, we are Volunteers!" and
was very Church-militant indeed, beginning thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, we are volunteers in the army of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forming into line at our Captain's word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are under marching orders to take the battle-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we'll ne'er give o'er the fight till the foe shall yield.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then came the chorus, repeated after every verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come and join the army, the army of the Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus is our Captain, we rally at His word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp will be the conflict with the powers of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with such a leader we are sure to win.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poor old minister offered up a short prayer.
The pastor read the 1st Corinthians, chapter 13, and
explained briefly what charity meant there; adding
that this gathering was very like one of the
Agap&aelig; of the early Christians&mdash;a remark I had not
expected to hear in that assembly. Then there was
another hymn, "Beautiful Land of Rest," when it did
one good to hear the unction with which the second
syllable of the refrain was given:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, Jerusalem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful land of rest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this the "Experiences" commenced in real
earnest. Brothers and Sisters were exhorted to lay
aside shyness and mount the platform. Of course no
one would do so at first; and the poor shaky old
minister had to come to the rescue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He told us, at rather too great length, the simple
story of his life&mdash;how he was a farmer's son, and had
several brothers "besides himself." He had to learn
verses of the Bible for his father, which used to go
against the grain, until at last, instead of being "a
wicked boy," he took up religion on his own account.
He began to be afraid that, if he died, he should go
to "a bad place," and therefore started saying his
prayers. His brother George used to push him over
when he was praying half-dressed in the bedroom, or
occasionally vary proceedings by stirring him up with
a sweeping brush. At last he found out a quiet place
under a haystack, and there retired to pray. The
old man drew a perfect picture of the first prayer thus
offered, and told us he could remember every little
detail of the spot, and the great oak tree spreading
its branches over it. "Here I am," he said, "a poor
old pilgrim on the bright side of seventy now, and
yet I can remember it all. I say the 'bright' side, for
I know it is a bright home I am soon going to." Then
he told us how God took his wife from him and all
his worldly goods, and he was quite eloquent about
the comfort his religion was to him now as he went
to his little lonely lodging. He drew next too
truthful a picture of the state of things he saw
around him in Kensal New Town&mdash;mothers with
infants in their arms crowding the tavern doors; and
finished up with a story, of which he did not see the
irrelevancy, about a fine lady going to the "theatre,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and saying how much she had enjoyed the anticipation,
then the play itself, and, lastly, the thought
of it afterwards. She was overheard by a faithful
pastor, who told her she had omitted one detail.
"No," she said, "I have told you all." "You have
told us how you enjoyed the thoughts of the theatre,
and the performance, and the recollection of it afterwards;
but you have not told us how you will
enjoy the thoughts of it on your death-bed." Of
course the "fine lady" was converted on the spot, as
they always are in tracts; and the good old fellow
brought his long-winded narrative of experiences to
an end by-and-by, the pastor having omitted to pull
his coat-tails, as he promised to do if any speaker
exceeded the allotted time. "The people were certainly
very attentive to hear him," and one man next
my boy expressed his satisfaction by letting off little
groans, like minute guns, at frequent intervals.</p>

<p>Then another hymn was sung, "The Beautiful Land
on High," which, by the way, is a favourite with the
spiritualists at their "Face S&eacute;ances." I half expected
to see a ghostly-looking visage peep out of
some corner cupboard, as I had often done with my
spiritual friends&mdash;that being another experience which
I cultivate with considerable interest and curiosity.
The hymn being over, a black-bearded, but soft-voiced
man, in a velveteen coat, got upon the platform, and
told us how the chief delight of his life was at one
time making dogs fight. When the animals were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sufficiently pugnacious of themselves, his habit was
to construct an apparatus, consisting of a pin at the
end of a stick, and so urge them to the combat, until
it proved fatal to one of them. It was, he said,
dreadful work; and he now considered it the direct
machination of Satan. Another favourite pursuit was
interrupting the proceedings of open-air missionaries.
One day after he had done so, he went home with a
companion who had taken a tract from one of the
missionaries. He had a quarrel with his "missis."
"Not that missis sittin' there," he said, alluding to a
smart lady in front, "but my first missis." In order
to show his sulks against his missis, he took to
reading the tract, and it soon made him cry. Then
he went to chapel and heard a sermon on Lot's wife
being turned into a pillar of salt. He was a little
exercised by this, and saw the minister in the vestry,
but soon fell back into bad habits again, singing
canaries for 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a side. As he was taking his
bird out one Sunday morning, the bottom of the cage
came out, and the canary escaped. This he looked
upon as "God's work," since it caused him to go to
chapel that morning. His conversion soon followed,
and he applied to that circumstance, in a very apposite
manner, the Parable of the Prodigal, concluding
with a stanza from the well-known hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God moves in a mysterious way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wonders to perform.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another moustached man followed. He was ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>ceedingly
well-dressed, though he told us he was only
a common labourer. He had long given up his "'art"
to God, but to little purpose until he came to this
chapel. "But there," he said, "down in that corner
under the gas-lamp, I prayed for the first time. I
prayed that God would take away my stony 'art and
give me a 'art of flesh, and renew a right sperrit
within me." From that time he led a new life. His
fellow-workmen began to sneer at the change, and
said ironically they should take to going to chapel
too. "I wish to God you would," was his reply. He
described the personal influence of the pastor upon him,
which strengthened the good resolutions he had formed,
and enabled him to say, "I will not let Thee go."</p>

<p>I could not help thinking, as I listened to the
simple, earnest words of the speaker, that here was an
element the National Church is too apt to ignore.
The Roman Catholic Church would seize hold upon
that man, and put him in a working men's guild or
confraternity. The Free Church found him work to
do, and gave him a chief seat in the synagogue, and
an opportunity of airing his "experiences" on a platform.
Surely better either one or the other, than
sotting his life at a public-house, or turning tap-room
orator. He ended by crying shame upon himself for
having put off the change until so late in life, and
added a wish that all the labouring classes could see,
as he had been brought to see, where their chief interest
as well as happiness lay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>A tall man from the choir followed, and was considerably
more self-possessed than the other two
speakers. He told us at the outset that he had been
"a Christian" for fourteen years. It was generally
laid down as a rule, he said, that big men were good-tempered.
He was not a small man; but until he
gave his heart to God he was never good-tempered.
He had, for thirty-two years, been brought up in the
Church of England, but had found no conversion
there. He had no wish to speak against the Church,
but such was the case. He wandered about a good
deal in those years, from Roman Catholic to Old
Methodist chapels; but the latter settled him. He
was attending a class meeting in Kensal New Town
one night, and suddenly a determination came over
him that he would not sleep that night until he had
kneeled down and prayed with his wife, though it
would be the first time he had done so for thirty-two
years. When it came to bedtime his courage failed
him. He could not get into bed; and he did not
like to tell his wife why. "That," he said, "was the
devil worritin' me." His wife said, "I know what's
the matter with you. You want to pray. We will
see what we can do." His wife, he told us, was "unconverted,"
but still she "throwed open the door" on
that occasion. He never knew happiness, he said,
until he came to Jesus; and he added, "Oh, I do
love my Jesus." He often talked to his fellow-workmen
about the state of their souls, and they asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
him how it was he was so certain of being converted
(a question I fancy others than they would like to
have solved), and he answered them, "I feel it. I
was uncomfortable before; and now I am happy. I
don't wonder so much at the old martyrs going
boldly up to the stake, because I feel I could do anything
rather than give up my Jesus."</p>

<p>Hereupon the pastor, anticipating the departure of
some of the assembly&mdash;for the clock was pointing to
ten&mdash;announced a Temperance Meeting for the following
Monday, and also said he should like the congregation
to get up these meetings entirely on their
own account, without any "clerical" element at all,
and to make the Tea Meeting a "Free and Easy" in
the best sense of the word.</p>

<p>I went&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;to the experience
meeting rather inclined to scoff, and I stopped, if not
altogether to pray, at least to think very seriously of
the value of the instrumentality thus brought to bear
on such intractable material as the Kensal New Town
population. The more cumbrous, even if more perfect
or polished, machinery of the Established Church
has notoriously failed for a long time to affect such
raw material; and if it is beginning to succeed it is
really by "taking a leaf out of the book" of such
pastors as the one whose Tea-and-Experience Meeting
I had attended. "Palmam qui meruit ferat."</p>

<p>Stiggins element, I must, in all justice, say there
was none. The pastor was a simple but a refined and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
gentlemanly man; so was the poor broken old minister.
There was no symptom of raving or rant; no
vulgarity or bad taste. A gathering at a deanery or
an episcopal palace could not have been more decorous,
and I doubt if the hymns would have been sung
as heartily. There was as little clerical starch as
there was of the opposite element. Rubbing off the
angles of character was one of the objects actually
proposed by the pastor as the result of these gatherings;
and I really felt as though a corner or two had
gone out of my constitution. If a man is disposed to
be priggish, or a lady exclusive, in religious matters,
I would recommend the one or the other to avail
themselves of the next opportunity to attend a Tea-and-Experience
Meeting at Kensal New Town.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>SUNDAY LINNET-SINGING.</h3>


<p>There is something very Arcadian and un-Cockney-like
in the idea of linnet-singing in Lock's Fields.
Imagination pictures so readily the green pastures
and the wild bird's song, and Corydon with his pipe
and his Phyllis, that it seems a pity to disabuse that
exquisite faculty of our nature so far as to suggest
that the linnets of which we speak are not wild, but
tame and caged, and the fields very much less rural
than those of Lincoln's Inn. This was the announcement
that drew me to the New Kent Road on a
recent Sunday morning to hear what poor Cockney
Keats called the "tender-legged linnets:" "Bird-singing.&mdash;A
match is made between Thomas Walker
(the Bermondsey Champion) and William Hart
(Champion of Walworth) to sing two linnets, on
Sunday, for 2<i>l.</i> a side; birds to be on the nail precisely
at two o'clock; the host to be referee. 10<i>s.</i> is
now down; the remainder by nine this evening, at
the Jolly Butchers, Rodney Road, Lock's Fields.
Also a copper kettle will be sung for on the same
day by six pairs of linnets; first pair up at half-past
six o'clock in the evening. Any person requiring the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
said room for matches, &amp;c., on making application to
the host, will immediately be answered."</p>

<p>Rodney Road, be it known, is anything but a
romantic thoroughfare, leading out of the New Kent
Road, a little way from the Elephant and Castle;
and the caravanserai bearing the title of the Jolly
Butchers is an unpretending beershop, with no outward
and visible signs of especial joviality. On
entering I met mine host, rubicund and jolly enough,
who politely pioneered me upstairs, when I reported
myself as in quest of the linnets. The scene of
contest I found to be a largish room, where some
twenty or thirty most un-Arcadian looking gentlemen
were already assembled, the only adjunct at all symptomatic
of that pastoral district being their pipes, at
which they were diligently puffing. The whole of
the tender-legged competitors, both for the money
and the copper kettle, were hanging in little square
green cages over the fireplace; and the one idea
uppermost in my mind was how well the linnets
must be seasoned to tobacco smoke if they could sing
at all in the atmosphere which those Corydons were
so carefully polluting. Corydon, besides his pipe, had
adopted nuts and beer to solace the tedium of the
quarter of an hour that yet intervened before the
Bermondsey bird and its Walworth antagonist were
to be "on the nail;" and ever and anon fresh Corydons
kept dropping in, until some fifty or sixty had
assembled. They were all of one type. There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
"birdiness" discernible on the outer man of each;
for birdiness, as well as horseyness, writes its mark
on the countenance and the attire. In the latter
department there was a proclivity to thick pea-jackets
and voluminous white comforters round the neck,
though the day was springlike and the room stuffy.
The talk was loud, but not boisterous, and garnished
with fewer elegant flowers of speech than one would
have expected. Five minutes before two the non-competing
birds were carefully muffled up in pocket-handkerchiefs,
and carried in their cages out of earshot,
lest their twitterings might inspire the competing
minstrels. Bermondsey and Walworth alone
occupied the nails. Scarcely any bets were made.
They seemed an impecunious assemblage, gathered for
mere sport. One gentleman did, indeed, offer to stake
"that 'ere blowsy bob," as though a shilling in his
possession were a rarity of which his friends must be
certainly aware. What was the occult meaning of
the epithet "Blowsy" I could not fathom, but there
were no takers; and, after the windows had been
opened for a few minutes to clear the atmosphere,
they were closed again; the door locked; the two
markers took their place at a table in front of the
birds, with bits of chalk in their hands; mine host
stood by as referee in case of disputes; time was
called; and silence reigned supreme for a quarter of
an hour, broken only by the vocal performances of
the Bermondsey and Walworth champions respec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>tively.
If a hapless human being did so far forget
himself as to cough or tread incontinently upon a
nutshell, he was called to silence with curses not loud
but deep.</p>

<p>The Walworth bird opened the concert with a brilliant
solo by way of overture, which was duly reported
by the musical critic in the shape of a chalk line on
the table. The length of the effusion did not matter;
a long aria, or a brilliant but spasmodic cadenza, each
counted one, and one only. The Bermondsey bird,
heedless of the issue at stake, devoted the precious
moments to eating, emitting nothing beyond a dyspeptic
twitter which didn't count; and his proprietor
stood by me evidently chagrined, and perspiring profusely,
either from anxiety or superfluous attire.
Nearly half the time had gone by before Bermondsey
put forth its powers. Meanwhile, Walworth made
the most of the opportunity, singing in a manner of
which I did not know linnets were capable. There
were notes and passages in the r&eacute;pertoire of Walworth
which were worthy of a canary. The bird no doubt
felt that the credit of home art was at stake, and sang
with a vigour calculated to throw foreign feathered
artistes into the shade. Bermondsey evidently sang
best after dinner, so he dined like an alderman; yet
dined, alas! not wisely, but too well, or rather too
long. Then he sang, first, a defiant roulade or so, as
much as to say, "Can you beat that, Walworth?"
pausing, with his head wickedly on one side, for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
reply. That reply was not wanting, for Walworth
was flushed with success; and one could not help regretting
ignorance of bird-language so as to gather
exactly what the reply meant. Then came a protracted
duet between the two birds, which was the
pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of the whole performance. The
silence became irksome. I could not help congratulating
myself on the fact that no Corydon had brought
his Phyllis; for Phyllis, I am sure, would not have
been able to stand it. Phyllis, I feel certain, would
have giggled. We remained mute as mice, solemn as
judges. The ghost of a twitter was hailed with mute
signs of approval by the backers of each bird; but a
glance at the expressive features of the host warned
the markers that nothing must be chalked down that
did not come up to his idea of singing. Had the
destinies of empires hung upon his nod he could
scarcely have looked more oracular. But Walworth
could afford to take matters easily now. For the last
five minutes the Bermondsey bird did most of the
music; still it was a hopeless case. Success was not
on the cards. By-and-by, time was again called.
Babel recommenced, and the result stood as follows:</p>

<p>
Walworth              3 score 18<br />
Bermondsey            1 score 10<br />
</p>

<p>It was an ignominious defeat truly; and, had one
been disposed to moralize, it had not been difficult to
draw a moral therefrom. It was not a case of "no
song, no supper;" but of supper&mdash;or, rather, dinner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&mdash;and
no song. Bermondsey had failed in the artistic
combat, not from lack of powers, as its brilliant part
in the duet and its subsequent soli proved, but simply
from a Sybaritic love for creature comforts. I ventured
to suggest it might have been expedient to
remove the seed, but was informed that, under those
circumstances, the creature&mdash;its proprietor called it
an uglier name&mdash;would not have sung at all. The
remarkable part of the business to me was that they
did sing at the proper time. They had not uttered
anything beyond a twitter until silence was called,
and from that moment one or the other was singing
incessantly. I suppose it was the silence. I have
noticed not only caged birds, but children&mdash;not to
speak ungallantly of the fair sex&mdash;generally give
tongue most freely when one is silent, and presumably
wants to keep so.</p>

<p>The contest, however, was over, the stakes paid,
and Corydon sought his pastoral pipe again&mdash;not
without beer. It was a new experience, but not a
very exciting one&mdash;to me, at least. It evidently had
its attractions for the very large majority of attendants.
In fact, Rodney Road is generally a "birdy" neighbourhood.
Its staple products, to judge by the shops,
seemed birds and beer. I was much pressed by mine
host to stay for the evening entertainment, when six
birds were to sing, and the attendance would be more
numerous. As some five hours intervened I expressed
regret at my inability to remain, reserving my opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that five hours in Lock's Fields might prove the reverse
of attractive, and Corydon in greater force might
not have an agreeable effect on that already stuffy
chamber. So I took myself off, wondering much, by
the way, what strange association of ideas could have
led any imaginative man to propose such an incongruous

<h3>A WOMAN'S RIGHTS DEBATE.</h3>


<p>There never was a time when, on all sorts of subjects,
from Mesmerism to Woman's Rights, the ladies had
so much to say for themselves. There is an ancient
heresy which tells us that, on most occasions, ladies
are prone to have the last word; but certain it is that
they are making themselves heard now. On the special
subject of her so-called "Rights" the abstract Woman
was, I knew, prodigiously emphatic&mdash;how emphatic,
though, I was not quite aware, until having seen from
the top of a City-bound omnibus that a lady whom I
will describe by the Aristophanic name of Praxagora
would lecture at the Castle Street Co-operative Institute.
I went and co-operated so far as to form one
of that lady's audience. Her subject&mdash;the "Political
Status of Women"&mdash;was evidently attractive, not
only to what we used in our innocence to call the
weaker sex, but also to those who are soon to have
proved to them the fallacy of calling themselves the
stronger. A goodly assemblage had gathered in the
fine hall of the Co-operators to join in demolishing
that ancient myth as to the superiority of the male
sex. My first intention was to have reported verbatim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
or nearly so the oration of Praxagora on the subject;
and if I changed my scheme it was not because that
lady did not deserve to be reported. She said all that
was to be said on the matter, and said it exceedingly
well too; but when the lecture, which lasted fifty
minutes, was over, I found it was to be succeeded by a
debate; and I thought more might be gained by chronicling
the collision of opinion thence ensuing than
by simply quoting the words of any one speaker, however
eloquent or exhaustive.</p>

<p>I own with fear and trembling&mdash;for it is a delicate,
dangerous avowal&mdash;that, as a rule, I do not sympathize
with the ladies who declaim on the subject of
Woman's Rights. I do not mean to say I lack sympathy
with the subject&mdash;I should like everybody to
have their rights, and especially women&mdash;but they
are sometimes asserted in such a sledge-hammer
fashion, and the ladies who give them utterance are
so prone to run large and be shrill-voiced that their
very physique proves their claim either unnecessary
or undesirable. I feel certain that in whatever station
of domestic life those ladies may be placed, they
would have their full rights, if not something more;
and as for Parliamentary rights, I tremble for the unprotected
males should such viragos ever compass the
franchise; or, worse still, realize the ambition of the
Ecclesiazus&aelig; of Aristophanes, and sit on the benches
of St. Stephen's clad in the nether garments of the
hirsute sex. There was nothing of that kind on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Tuesday night. In manner and appearance our present
Praxagora was thoroughly feminine, and, by her
very quietude of manner, impressed me with a consciousness
of power, and determination to use it.
Her voice was soft and silvery almost as that of Miss
Faithfull herself; and when, at the outset of her lecture,
she claimed indulgence on the score of never
having spoken in a public hall before, we had to press
forward to the front benches to catch the modulated
tones, and men who came clumping in with heavy
boots in the course of the lecture were severely hushed
down by stern-visaged females among the audience.</p>

<p>Disclaiming connexion with any society, Praxagora
still adopted the first person plural in speaking of the
doctrines and intentions of the down-trodden females.
"We" felt so and so; "we" intended to do this or
that; and certainly her cause gained by the element
of mystery thus introduced, as well as by her own
undoubted power of dealing with the subject. When
the "we" is seen to refer to the brazen-voiced ladies
aforesaid, and a few of the opposite sex who appear
to have changed natures with the gentle ones they
champion, that plural pronoun is the reverse of imposing,
but the "we" of Praxagora introduced an element
of awe, if only on the omne ignotum pro magnifico
principle. In the most forcible way she went through
the stock objections against giving women the franchise,
and knocked them down one by one like so
many ninepins. That coveted boon of a vote she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
proved to be at the basis of all the regeneration of
women. She claimed that woman should have her
share in making the laws by which she was governed,
and denied the popular assertion that in so doing she
would quit her proper sphere. In fact, we all went
with her up to a certain point, and most of the
audience beyond that point. For myself I confess I
felt disheartened when, having dealt in the most consummate
way with other aspects of the subject, she
came to the religious phase, and begging the question
that the Bible and religion discountenanced woman's
rights, commenced what sounded to me like a furious
attack on each.</p>

<p>Now I happen to know&mdash;what perhaps those who
look from another standpoint do not know&mdash;that this
aggressive attitude assumed so unnecessarily by the
advocates of woman's rights is calculated to keep back
the cause more than anything else; and matter and
manner had been so much the reverse of hostile up to
the moment she plunged incontinently into the
religious question, that it quite took me by surprise.
I have known scores of people who, when they came
under vigorous protest to hear Miss Emily Faithfull
on the same fertile subject, went away converted
because they found no iconoclasm of this kind in her
teaching. They came to scoff and stopped, not indeed
to pray, but to listen very attentively to a theme
which has so much to be said in its favour that
it is a pity to complicate its advocacy by the introduc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>tion
of an extraneous and most difficult question. So
it was, however; with pale, earnest face, and accents
more incisive than before, Praxagora said if Bible and
religion stood in the way of Woman's Rights,
then Bible and religion must go. That was the gist
of her remarks. I need not follow her in detail,
because the supplementary matter sounded more
bitterly still; and, had she not been reading from MS.
I should have thought the lecturer was carried away
by her subject; but no, she was reading quite calmly
what were clearly enough her natural and deliberate
opinions. I said I was surprised at the line she took.
Perhaps I ought scarcely to have been so, for she was
flanked on one side by Mr. Bradlaugh, on the other by
Mr. Holyoake! but I never remember being so struck
with a contrast as when at one moment Praxagora
pictured the beauty of a well-regulated home, and the
tender offices of woman towards the little children,
and then shot off at a tangent to fierce invectives
against the Bible and religion, which seemed so
utterly uncalled for that no adversary who wanted to
damage the cause could possibly have invented a more
complete method of doing so.</p>

<p>The lecture over, the chairman invited discussion,
and a fierce little working man immediately mounted the
platform and took Praxagora to task for her injudicious
onslaught. But, as usual, this gentleman was wildly
irrelevant and carried away by his commendable zeal.
Over and over again he had to be recalled to the ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>tion,
until finally he set his whole audience against
him, and had to sit down abruptly in the middle of a
sort of apotheosis of Moses&mdash;as far as I could hear,
for his zeal outran his eloquence as well as his discretion,
and rendered him barely audible. A second
speaker followed, and, though cordially sympathizing
with the address, and tracing woman's incapacity to her
state of subjugation, regretted that such a disturbing
element as religion had been mixed up with a social
claim. He considered that such a subject must inevitably
prove an apple of discord. For this he was
at once severely handled by Mr. Bradlaugh, who, consistently
enough, defended the line Praxagora adopted
towards the religious question, and justified the introduction
of the subject from the charge of irrelevance.
He also deprecated the surprise which the last speaker
had expressed at the excellent address of Praxagora by
pointing out that in America about one-third of the
press were females, a fact which he attributed to the
plan of Mixed Education. Then a new line was opened
up by a speaker&mdash;it was as impossible to catch
their names as to hear the stations announced by
porters on the Underground Railway. He predicted
that if women did get the franchise, Mr. Bradlaugh's
"Temple" would be shut up in six months, as well as
those of Messrs. Voysey and Conway and Dr. Perfitt.
The ladies, he said, were swayed by Conventionalism
and Priestcraft, and until you educated them, you
could not safely give them the franchise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>A youthful Good Templar mounted the rostrum,
for the purpose of patting Praxagora metaphorically on
the back, and also ventilating his own opinions on the
apathy of the working man in claiming his vote.
Then somebody got up and denied that ladies were
by nature theological. Their virtues were superior
to those of men just as their voices were an octave
higher. He was for having a Moral Department of
the State presided over by ladies. Only one lady
spoke; a jaunty young woman in a sailor's hat, who
said that in religious persecutions men, not women,
had been the persecutors; and then Praxagora rose to
reply. She first of all explained her position with
regard to the Bible, which she denied having unnecessarily
attacked. The Bible forbade a woman to
speak; and, that being so, the Bible must stand on
one side, for "we" were going to speak. That the
highest intellects had been formed on Bible models
she denied by instancing Shelley. If she thought
that this movement was going to destroy the womanhood
of her sex she would not move a finger for its
furtherance. She only thought it would give a
higher style of womanhood. As to women requiring
to be educated before they would know how to use
the franchise, she pointed triumphantly to the Government
which men had placed in power. It was
significant, she said, that the first exercise of the
working men's franchise had been to place a Conservative
Government in office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>I daresay I am wrong, but the impression left on
my mind by the discussion was that the liberty of
thought and action claimed was the liberty of thinking
as "<i>we</i>" think and doing what "<i>we</i>" want to have
done&mdash;a process which has been before now mistaken
for absolute freedom. Stripped of its aggressive adjuncts,
Praxagora's advocacy of her main subject would
be telling in the extreme from the fact of her blending
such thorough womanliness of person, character, and
sentiment with such vigorous championship of a
doctrine against which I do not believe any prejudice
exists. Drag in the religious difficulty, however, and
you immediately array against it a host of prejudices,
whether reasonable ones or the reverse is not now the
question. I am only concerned with the unwisdom
of having called them into existence. I own I
thought that Christianity had been the means of
raising woman from her state of Oriental degradation
to the position she occupies in civilized countries.
But I was only there to listen, not to speak; and I
confess I came away in a divided frame of mind. I
was pleased with the paper, but irritated to think
that a lady, holding such excellent cards, should risk
playing a losing game.</p>

<h3>AN OPEN-AIR TICHBORNE MEETING.</h3>


<p>When Sydney Smith, from the depths of his barbarian
ignorance, sought to rise to the conception of a
Puseyite, he said in substance much as follows:&mdash;"I
know not what these silly people want, except to
revive every obsolete custom which the common sense
of mankind has allowed to go to sleep." Puseyism is
not to our present purpose; but Tichborne-ism is&mdash;for
it has attained to the dignity of a veritable ism&mdash;and
we may define it much after the same method, as
an attempt, not, indeed, to revive the claims of, but
to restore to society a person, who, after a trial of
unexampled length, was consigned by the verdict of a
jury, and the consequent sentence of the Lord Chief
Justice, to the possibly uncongenial retirement of
Millbank Penitentiary. With the rights or wrongs
of such an event I have simply nothing to do. I
abandoned the Tichborne Trial at an early stage in a
condition of utter bewilderment; and directly an old
gentleman sought to button-hole me, and argue that
he must be the man, or he couldn't be the man, I
made off, or changed the conversation as rapidly as I
could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But when the question had at length been resolved
by wiser heads than mine, and when, too, I felt I could
write calmly, with no fear of an action for contempt
of court before my eyes, I confess that a poster
announcing an open-air Tichborne meeting in Mr.
Warren's cricket-field, Notting Hill, was too fascinating
for me. I had heard of such gatherings in
provincial places and East End halls; but this invasion
of the West was breaking new ground. I
would go; in fine I went. On the evening of an
exceptionally hot July day, I felt there might be
worse places than Mr. Warren's breezy cricket ground
alongside Notting Barn Farm; so six o'clock, the
hour when the chair was to be taken, found me at the
spot&mdash;first of the outer world&mdash;and forestalled only
by a solitary Tichbornite. How I knew that the
gentleman in question deserved that appellation I
say not; but I felt instinctively that such was the case.
He had a shiny black frock-coat on, like a well-to-do
artisan out for a holiday, and a roll of paper protruding
from his pocket I rightly inferred to be a
Tichborne petition for signature. As soon as we got
on the ground, and I was enjoying the sensation of
the crisp well rolled turf beneath my feet, a man hove
in sight with a table, and this attracted a few
observers. A gentleman in a light coat, too, who
was serenely gazing over the hedge at the Kensington
Park Cricket Club in the next ground, was, they
informed me, Mr. Guildford Onslow. The presiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
genius of the place, however, was Mrs. Warren, who,
arrayed in a gown of emerald green&mdash;as though she
were attending a Fenian meeting&mdash;bustled about in a
state of intense excitement until the greengrocer's
cart, which was to serve as a rostrum, had arrived.
When this occurred, the table and half a dozen
Windsor chairs were hoisted into it; another table
was arranged below the van, with the Tichborne
Petition outspread upon it; and I fancied that
arrangements were complete.</p>

<p>Not so, however. The gentleman in the shiny
coat and emerald green Mrs. Warren between them
tin-tacked up a long scroll or "legend" along the rim
of the van, consisting of the text from Psalm xxxv.
11:&mdash;"False witnesses did rise up against me. They
laid to my charge things that I knew not." The
association of ideas was grotesque, I know, but really
as Mrs. Warren and the shiny artisan were nailing
this strip to the greengrocer's van, they put me very
much in mind of a curate and a lady friend "doing
decorations" at Christmas or Eastertide. Nor was this
all. When the "strange device" was duly tin-tacked,
some workmen brought four long pieces of quartering,
and a second strip of white calico with letters stuck
on it was nailed to these; and when the stalwart
fellows hoisted it in air and tied the two centre pieces
of wood to the wheels of the greengrocer's cart, I
found that it consisted of the Ninth Commandment.
The self-sacrificing carpenters were to hold&mdash;and did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
hold&mdash;the outside poles banner-wise during the entire
evening; and, with one slight exception, this banner
with the strange device, No. 2, formed an appropriate,
if not altogether ornamental background for the greengrocer's
van. Knots of people had gathered during
these proceedings; and I was confused to find that I
was being generally pointed out as Mr. Onslow, that
gentleman having retired to the privacy of Mr.
Warren's neighbouring abode. Later on I was taken
for a detective, because, in my innocence, I withdrew
ever and anon from the crowd, and, sitting on a
verdurous bank, jotted down a note in my pocket-book;
but this got me into such bad odour by-and-by
that I felt it better to desist, and trust to memory.
Some of the smaller boys also averred that I was Sir
Roger himself, but their youthful opinions were too
palpably erroneous to carry weight.</p>

<p>In due course the van was occupied by Mr. Onslow,
the Rev. Mr. Buckingham (about whom I felt, of
course, very curious), my shining artisan, and a few
others. A thin-faced gentleman, whose name I could
not catch, was voted to the chair, and announced to
us that he should go on talking awhile in order that
Messrs. Onslow and Buckingham might "refresh," as
they had each come from the country. This they did
coram publico in the cart, while the chairman kept us
amused. The wind, too, was blowing pretty freshly,
and was especially hard on the Ninth Commandment,
which gave considerable trouble to the holders of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
props. It was directly in the teeth of the speaker,
too&mdash;an arrangement which Mrs. Warren, in her zeal,
had overlooked; and it was decided by common consent
to "reverse the meeting"&mdash;that is, to turn the
chairs of the speakers round, so that the Ninth Commandment
was nowhere, and looked like an Egyptian
hieroglyph, as the reversed letters showed dimly
through the calico. The chairman eventually read to
the meeting, which was now a tolerably full one, the
form of petition which was to serve as the single resolution
of the evening. I was struck with this gentleman's
departure from conventional legal phraseology
on this occasion. Instead of naming the cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre
"The Queen <i>versus</i> Castro" (it being written, as Sam
Weller says, with a "wee") he termed it "The Queen
<i>via</i> Castro!" The petition was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That in the trial at Bar in the Court of Queen's
Bench, on an indictment of the Queen v. Castro, alias
Arthur Orton, alias Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne,
Bart., for perjury, the jury, on the 28th day of
February, 1874, brought in a verdict of guilty against
him, declaring him to be Arthur Orton, and he was
sentenced to fourteen years' penal servitude, which he
is now undergoing.</p>

<p>"That your petitioners have reason to know and
believe and are satisfied, both from the evidence
produced at the trial and furnished since, and from
their own personal knowledge that he is not Arthur
Orton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"That though 280 witnesses were examined at the
said trial in his behalf, a very large number more, as
your petitioners have been informed and believe, were
also ready to be examined, but that funds were not
available for the purpose, the defendant having been
entirely dependent on the voluntary subscriptions of
the public for his defence.</p>

<p>"That your petitioners submit that such a large
number as 280 witnesses, most of whom gave positive
evidence that the defendant was not Arthur Orton,
and whose testimony in two instances only was questioned
in a court of law&mdash;as against about 200 witnesses
for the prosecution, whose evidence was chiefly
of a negative character&mdash;was of itself enough to raise
a doubt in the defendant's favour, of which doubt he
ought to have had the benefit, in accordance both
with the law and the custom of the country.</p>

<p>"That, under the circumstances, your petitioners
submit that he had not a fair trial, and they pray
your honourable House to take the matter into your
serious consideration, with a view to memorialize her
Majesty to grant a free pardon."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Buckingham, a cheery gentleman
who bore a remarkable resemblance to the celebrated
Mr. Pickwick, rose to move the resolution; and I
could not help noticing that, not content with the
ordinary white tie of clerical life, he had "continued
the idea downwards" in a white waistcoat, which
rather altered the state of things. He spoke well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and forcibly I should think for an hour, confining his
remarks to the subject of "Sir Roger" not being
Arthur Orton. He (Mr. Buckingham) belonged to
some waterside mission at Wapping, and had known
Arthur Orton familiarly from earliest boyhood. His
two grievances were that his negative evidence had
not been taken, and that he was now being continually
waited on by "Jesuits," who temptingly
held out cheques for 1000<i>l.</i> to him if he would only
make affidavit that the man in Millbank was Arthur
Orton.</p>

<p>Mr. Onslow, who seconded the resolution, however,
made the speech of the evening, and was so enthusiastically
received that he had to recommence several
times after glowing perorations. The burden of Mr.
Onslow's prophecy was the unfairness of the trial;
and his "bogies" were detectives, just as Mr. Buckingham's
were Jesuits. The Jean Luie affair was
the most infernal "plant" in the whole case; and he
read records of conflicting evidence which really were
enough to make one pack up one's traps and resolve
on instant emigration. He was, however, certainly
right on one point. He said that such meetings were
safety-valves which prevented revolution. No doubt
this was a safety-valve. It amused the speakers, and
Mrs. Warren and the glazed artisan; and it could do
nobody any possible harm. Whether it was likely to
do the man of Millbank any good was quite another
matter, and one which, of course, it was quite beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
my purpose to discuss. There was a deal of&mdash;to
me&mdash;very interesting speaking; for I gained new
light about the case, and stood until my legs fairly
ached listening to Messrs. Buckingham and Onslow.</p>

<p>When the editor of the <i>Tichborne Gazette</i> claimed
an innings it was another matter; and&mdash;perhaps with
lack of esprit de corps&mdash;I decamped. I only saw this
gentleman gesticulating as I left the field; but the
rate at which he was getting up the steam promised
a speech that would last till nightfall.</p>

<p>As I went off the ground I was struck with the
clever way in which a London costermonger will turn
anything and everything to account. One of them
was going about with a truck of cherries, crying out,
"Sir Roger Tichborne cherries. Penny a lot!"</p>

<p>There was no symptom of overt opposition, though
opponents were blandly invited to mount the waggon
and state their views; but there was a good deal of
quiet chaff on the outskirts of the crowd, which is
the portion I always select on such occasions for my
observation. On the whole, however, the assembly
was pretty unanimous; and though it never assumed
the dimensions of a "monster meeting," the fact that
even so many people could be got together for such
a purpose seemed to me sufficiently a sign of the
times to deserve annotation in passing.</p>

<h3>SUNDAY IN A PEOPLE'S GARDEN.</h3>


<p>I have often thought that an interesting series of
articles might be written on the subject of "London
out of Church," dealing with the manners and customs
of those people who patronize no sort of religious
establishment on the Sunday. I have seen pretty well
all the typical phases of religious London and London
irreligious; but these would rather be characterized as
non-religious than as irreligious folks. They do not
belong to any of the varied forms of faith; in fact
faith is from their life a thing apart. It is in this
negative way that they are interesting. Sunday is
with them only a regularly recurring Bank Holiday.
It would be interesting to know what they do with it.
A special difficulty, however, exists for me in any such
inquiry, resulting from the fact that, in my capacity
of clerical casual, I am pretty generally engaged on
the Sunday; and when I am not, my Day of Rest is
too valuable to be devoted to any of the manifold forms
of metropolitan Sabbath-breaking. I have a great
idea that parsons ought to be frequently preached at;
and so I generally go to some church or chapel when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out of harness myself; and if "hearing sermons"
constitute the proper carrying out of the things promised
and vowed on my behalf at baptism I must
have undergone as complete a course of Christian discipline
as any man in Christendom, for I have been
preached at by everybody from Roman Catholics down
to Walworth Jumpers and Plumstead Peculiars!</p>

<p>But impressed with anxiety to know about the
doings of the non-Church-goers, I have for a long
time cast sheep's eyes at the Sunday League, and
more than once definitely promised to join one of their
Sunday outings; but I am strongly of Tom Hood's
opinion that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The man who's fond precociously of stirring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be a <i>spoon</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Sunday League commence their excursions at
untimely hours; and it is a cardinal point in my creed
that Sunday ought to be a Day of Rest, at all events
in the matter of breakfast in bed. I missed the excursion
to Shakspeare's House in this way, and the
paper on the Bard of Avon, full of the genius loci,
must have been as edifying as a sermon. So, too, on
a recent Sunday, when the Sunday League on their
way to Southend got mixed up with the Volunteer
Artillery going to Shoebury, I was again found
wanting. But still the old penchant remained, and
Sunday was my last free one for a long time. How
could I utilize it? I had it; I would go to the
People's Garden at Willesden. I had heard that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
certain very mild forms of Sabbath breaking prevailed
there. I would go and see for myself.</p>

<p>I had been at the People's Garden twice before;
once on the occasion of a spiritualistic picnic, and once,
more recently, at a workmen's flower show; and felt
considerable interest in the place, especially as the
People had been polite enough to send me a season
ticket, so that I was one of the People myself.</p>

<p>This People's Garden was not exactly a Paradise
yet, though it is in a fair way of becoming one. It
is a spot of some fifty acres reclaimed from the scrubbiest
part of Wormwood Scrubbs, and made the focus
of a club of working men, of whom I am very proud
indeed to be one. Indeed, I do not see why throughout
the remainder of this article I should not use the
first person plural. I will. Well, then, we secured
this spot, and we have got in the first place one of the
finest&mdash;I believe the finest&mdash;dancing platforms in
England, for we as a community are Terpsichorean,
though I, as an individual, am not. I felt it necessary
to give up dancing when my weight turned the
balance at fourteen stone odd. Then we can give our
friends refreshments from a bottle of champagne down
to tea and cresses. We have all sorts of clubs, dramatic
and otherwise, and rather plume ourselves on
having put up our proscenium ourselves, that is with
our own hands and hammers and nails. There is the
great advantage of being a Working Man or one of
the People. If you had been with me that Sunday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
you would have seen a glow of conscious pride suffusing
my countenance as I read the bills of our last
amateur performance, consisting of the "Waterman"
and "Ici on parle Fran&ccedil;ais," played on the boards
which I, in my corporate capacity, had planed, and
sawn, and nailed. My route last Sunday lay across
the crisp sward of the Scrubbs; and it was quite a
pleasure to be able to walk there without danger of
falling pierced by the bullet of some erratic volunteer;
for there are three butts on Wormwood Scrubbs, which
I examined with minuteness on Sunday, and was exercised
to see by marks on the brickwork how very
wide of the target a volunteer's shot can go. I
wonder there is not a wholesale slaughter of cattle in
the neighbouring fields. The garden lies on the other
side of the Great Western Railway, across which I
had to trespass in order to get to it. But the man in
charge regarded me with indulgence, for was I not a
working man and a "mate?" The portion of the
garden abutting on the rail is still unreclaimed prairie.
The working men have begun at the top of the hill,
and are working downwards.</p>

<p>There is a good-sized refreshment-room at the
entrance, with all the paraphernalia of secretary's
office, &amp;c.; and this large room, which is exceedingly
useful in wet weather, opens right on to the dancing-platform,
in the centre of which is a pretty kiosk for
the band. We have no gas; but tasty paraffin lamps
at frequent intervals give sufficient light, and, at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
events, do not smell <i>worse</i> than modern metropolitan
gas. There is a large tent standing en permanence
during the summer for flower shows, and terrace after
terrace of croquet lawns, all of which it will, I fear,
shock some Sabbatarian persons to learn were occupied
on that Sunday afternoon, and the balls kept
clicking like the week-day shots of the erratic riflemen
on the Scrubbs. I had a young lady with me who was
considerably severe on the way in which we workmen
male and female, handled our mallets. There was, I
confess, something to be desired in the way of position;
and one group of German artisans in the corner
lawn made more noise than was necessary, howling
and uttering all sorts of guttural interjections, as
though they were playing polo at least, or taking part
in a bull-fight, instead of in croquet&mdash;beloved of
curates.</p>

<p>And then the flowers. We are making the desert
blossom like the rose. It is really marvellous to see
what has been done in so short a time. We might
have been a society of market gardeners. We don't
get so many flowers along the walk of life, we working
men; so that we want to see a bit of green sward
and a flower or two on Sundays. There is a capital
gymnasium, and our observation of the young men
who disport themselves there would lead an uninitiated
observer to form the opinion that the normal
condition of humanity was upside down. The way
one youthful workman hung by his legs on the tra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>peze
was positively Darwinian to behold. Swings
attracted the attention of the ladies; and I regret to
say that the particular young lady I escorted&mdash;who
was of the mature age of twelve&mdash;passed most of the
afternoon in a state of oscillation, and was continually
adjuring me to push her.</p>

<p>An interesting addition to the gardens&mdash;our gardens&mdash;since
I was last there, consisted of a cage of
meditative monkeys, four in number, who were stationed
so near the gymnasium as inevitably to suggest
the Darwinian parallel. They had their gymnasium
too, and swung gaily on their tree-trunks at
such times as they were not engaged in eating or
entomological researches. I could not help thinking
what a deprivation it was to the gymnasts that, in
course of evolution, we have lost our tails. They
would have been so convenient on the horizontal bar,
where that persevering young workman was still
engaged in the pursuit of apoplexy by hanging head
downwards. Soon after we got there an excellent
band commenced playing, not in the kiosk, lest we
should be beguiled into dancing. The first piece was
a slow movement, which could scarcely have been
objected to by any Sabbatarian, unless he was so uncompromising
as to think all trumpets wrong. The
second was the glorious march from "Athalie;" and
then&mdash;my blood runs cold as I write it&mdash;a sort of
pot pourri, in the midst of which came the "Dutchman's
Little Wee Dog," considerably disguised in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
way of accompaniment and variation, I own, but the
"Little Wee Dog" beyond a doubt. Then I understood
why the band was not in the kiosk; for, fourteen
stone though I be, I felt all my toes twiddling
inside my boots at that time as wickedly as though it
had been Monday morning. There were fourteen or
fifteen loud brass instruments, with a side and bass
drum and cymbals. All these were playing the
"Little Wee Dog" to their brazen hearts' content,
and only one gentleman on a feeble piccolo-flute trying
to choke their impiety by tootling out a variation,
just as the stringed instruments in the glorious
"Reformation Symphony" of Mendelssohn try in
vain to drown with their sensuous Roman airs the
massive chords of the old Lutheran chorale&mdash;"Ein
feste Burg ist unser Gott." I really could not bear
it any longer, and was rising to go when they
stopped; and as the gentleman who played the circular
bass got outside his portentous instrument, I
found he had a little wee dog of his own who retired
into the bell of the big trumpet when his master laid
it on the grass. Perhaps it was in honour of this
minute animal the air was selected. However, I could
not lend myself to such proceedings; so I bribed my
youthful charge with a twopenny bottle of frothless
ginger beer to come out of her swing and return to
the regions of orthodoxy. The Teutonic gentlemen
were still hooting and yelling as we crossed the
corner of their croquet lawn, until I expected to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them attack one another with the mallets and use the
balls for missile warfare; but it was only their peculiar
way of enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>My little friend described the action of our working
men in the croquet lawn as "spooning," and also
drew my attention to the fact that two lovers were
doing the same on a seat, in the approved fashion
prevalent among us workmen, with the manly arm
around the taper waist coram publico. This arrangement
is quite a necessity with us. We should often
like to forego it, especially when little boys make rude
remarks about us in the street; but it is expected of
us, and we submit.</p>

<p>The sun was beginning to sink grandly over that
magnificent panorama of country visible from Old
Oak Common as we passed down the hill and again
violated the bye-laws of the Great Western Railway
Company. The spires of the West End churches
were bathed in the soft glow of departing day; and
in the distance the Crystal Palace glittered like a
fairy bower. We got back after making a little
d&eacute;tour on account of some gentlemen who were
bathing in a very Paradisiacal way indeed&mdash;we actually
got back in time to go to church like good
Christians; and I do not think either of us felt much
the worse for the hours we had spent in the People's
Garden&mdash;save and except the wicked Little Wee
Dog!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>UTILIZING THE YOUNG LADIES.</h3>


<p>Time was when it was accepted as an axiom that
young ladies had no object in life but to be ornamental&mdash;no
mission but matrimony. The "accomplishments"
were the sum total of a genteel education,
though charged as "extras" on the half-yearly
accounts; and all the finished creature had to do, after
once "coming out," was to sit down and languidly
wait for an eligible suitor.</p>

<p>Times changed. And, in England, when we make
a change, we always rush violently into an opposite
extreme. Woman had a mission, and no mistake.
Now it was the franchise and Bloomer costume, just
as aforetime it was the pianoforte and general fascination.
Blue spectacles rose in the market. We had
lady doctors and female lawyers. The only marvel is
that there was no agitation for feminine curates.</p>

<p>Then came reaction again. It was discovered that
woman could be educated without becoming a bluestocking,
and practical without wearing bloomers or
going in for the suffrage. Still holding to the wholesome
principle that "woman is not undeveloped man,
but diverse," the real friends of the gentler sex dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>covered
a hundred and one ways in which it could
employ itself usefully and remuneratively. It was no
longer feared lest, as Sydney Smith puts it, if a woman
learnt algebra she would "desert her infant for a
quadratic equation;" and the University of Cambridge
soon fell in with the scheme for the Higher Education
of Women; while Miss Faithfull, and several others,
organized methods for employing practically the
talents which education could only develope in a
general way. It was to one of these methods&mdash;not
Miss Faithfull's&mdash;my attention was drawn a short
time since by a letter in the daily papers. The
Victoria Press and International Bureau are faits
accomplis, and it is well that efforts should be made
for utilizing in other ways that interesting surplus
in our female population. Mrs. Fernando, of
Warwick Gardens, Kensington, has set herself to
the solution of the problem, and the shape her method
takes is a Technical Industrial School for Women.</p>

<p>The object and aim of the institution is to examine,
plan, and organize such branches of industrial avocation
as are applicable to females, and open up new
avocations of useful industry compatible with the
intellectual and mechanical capabilities of the sex, not
forgetting their delicacy, and the untutored position
of females for practical application in all industrial
labour: to give the same facilities to females as are
enjoyed by males, in collective classes for special
training or special preparation for passing examina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>tions
open to women, thereby to enable them to earn
their livelihood with better success than is attainable
by mere school education only: to give special training
to females to qualify them to enter special
industrial avocations with such competency as will
enable them to be successful in obtaining employment:
to apprentice females, or to employ them directly into
trades where such employers will receive them beyond
the limits of the industrial school and where females
can be constantly employed, such as in composing,
embossing, illuminating, black-bordering, ticket-writing,
circular-addressing, flower-making, flower-cultivating,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Being a determined sceptic in the matter of prospectuses,
I determined to go and see for myself the
working of this scheme, which looked so well on
paper. The Institution occupies a large house exactly
opposite Dr. Punshon's chapel: and there is no chance
of one's missing it, for it is placarded with announcements
like a hoarding at election time. I found Mrs.
Fernando an exceedingly practical lady, doing all the
work of the institution herself, with the exception of
a few special subjects such as botany, &amp;c., which are
conducted by her husband. There are no "assistants,"
therefore, or deputed interests, the bane of so many
high-priced schools.</p>

<p>These classes are held in the evening from seven to
nine o'clock, and are intended for ladies above the age
of fifteen years, who may be engaged through the day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in various occupations, and for such as suffer from
neglected education, and who wish conveniently and
economically to improve themselves, without being
necessitated to mix with their juniors in day-schools.
These classes prepare ladies to meet the qualifications
necessary to enter clerkships and other official departments;
to bring them also to a standard to meet the
qualifications for post offices and telegraph departments;
and also to pass certain examinations open to
them. The charge is only 2<i>s.</i> per week&mdash;8<i>s.</i> per
month&mdash;1<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> per quarter. The first course embraces
spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, history, geography,
and grammar. The second course consists of
advanced arithmetic, book-keeping and commercial
instruction, so as to qualify women to take posts of
responsibility with marked success. The third course
consists of French, for practical usefulness. The
fourth course embraces simple or technical training in
such departments as are available within the limits of
the class-room&mdash;to qualify women to enter industrial
avocations with competency, and to make them successful
in obtaining employment. This department
will be extended to greater usefulness as conveniences
arise, by apprenticing the girls or employing them
directly in trades beyond the limits of the class-room,
where employers will receive them, or where
women could be consistently engaged&mdash;as, for instance,
in the work of compositors, ticket-writers, embossers,
&amp;c. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p>The two classes with which I was brought into
contact were the book-keeping and embossing. In
the former, more than a dozen young ladies were
being initiated in the mysteries of single and double
entry, and they posted up their books in a way that
made me feel very much ashamed of myself, when I
thought how incapable I should be of doing anything
half so useful. Many girls go from this
department to be book-keepers at large hotels, places
of business, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I then went to the embossing room, where six
presses were being worked by as many young ladies,
one in an adjoining room being reserved for Mrs.
Fernando, who not only tells her pupils what to do,
but shows them how to do it. The gilding and
colouring of the stamps was most elaborate; two
monograms of the Queen's name and that of the Empress
Eug&eacute;nie being perfect marvels of artistic and
intricate workmanship. Every process, from mixing
the colours up to burnishing the gold, was gone
through in detail by this practical lady and her intelligent
pupils for my special edification, and I passed
out a much wiser and certainly not a sadder man than
I entered this veritable hive of human bees.</p>

<p>No expense was spared in the education of these
girls, low as are the terms they pay. I saw quite a
ruinous heap of spoilt envelopes and fashionable sheets
of thick cream-laid; for they have to make their experiments
on the best material, and the slightest alte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>ration
in the position of a pin where the stamping
process has to be several times repeated spoils the
whole result. Mrs. Fernando has also introduced envelope
and circular addressing by women, as a department
of female industrial work in the Technical
Industrial School for Women, where a number of
females are employed between the hours of ten and
four o'clock, receiving satisfactory remuneration. She
provides the females employed in this department
evening classes free of charge, to improve themselves
in general education.</p>

<p>I am an intense admirer of the female sex in general,
and young ladies in particular, but really when I
came away, leaving my pretty book-keepers and embossers
to resume their normal work, and saw the
numbers of young ladies sitting listlessly over misnamed
"work" at the window, or walking languidly
nowhither in the streets, I thought that, without
losing any of their attractions, nay, adding a new
claim to the many existing ones on our regard, they
might with great advantage take a turn at Mrs.
Fernando's sixpenny lessons in technical education.</p>

<h3>FAIRLOP FRIDAY.</h3>


<p>Amongst those customs "more honoured in the
breach than the observance" which are rapidly being
stamped out by the advancing steps of civilization,
are the institutions which we can yet remember as so
popular in the days of our childhood, called pleasure
fairs. Like that social dodo in a higher section of
society, the "three-bottle man," with the stupid
Bacchanalian usages of which he was the embodiment,
these fairs are slowly but surely disappearing
as education spreads among the masses of the people.
In the country a fair is a simple and a necessary
thing enough. At certain seasons of the year, according
to the staple commodities for the sale of
which the assemblage was originally instituted, our
bucolic friends gather at early morning with the products
of their farms; a good deal of noisy buying,
selling, and barter takes place. Later in the day the
ladies invest their profits in a little mild finery, or in
simple pleasures; and, later still, when the public-houses
have done their work, comes a greater or lesser
amount of riot, rude debauchery, and vice; and then,
voil&agrave; tout&mdash;the fair is over for a year. One can easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
imagine the result of the transition when, from the
quiet country, the fair removes to the city or suburb.
In such places every utilitarian element is wanting,
and the gilt ginger-bread and gewgaws are only a
speciously innocent attraction towards the drinking
and dancing booth where the mischief is done. Well-wishers
to society are unromantic enough not to
regret the decidedly waning glories of these gatherings,
from the great Bartholomew Fair itself down to
that which, on the Friday of which I write, converted
many miles of thoroughfare at the East End
of London, as well as one of the prettiest forest
scenes still surrounding the metropolis, into a vast
al fresco tavern, where the "worship of Bacchus"
was as freely indulged as in any heathen temple of
ancient times.</p>

<p>Fairlop Fair&mdash;which has not yet died out, though
beginning to show satisfactory signs of decay&mdash;commenced
its existence, innocently enough, about a
century ago. At that time Mr. Day, a shipbuilder,
wishing to have a day's outing in the forest with his
friends and employ&eacute;s, fitted up a vessel on wheels,
fully rigged, in which he conveyed his picnic party
to Hainault Forest, on the outskirts of which, some
distance from Ilford, stood the famous Fairlop Oak.
The holiday became an annual custom, and gradually
changed its character from the simple gathering of a
master and his men into regular saturnalia; during
which, each year, from the first Friday in July, over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the ensuing Saturday and Sunday, riot and debauchery
reigned supreme in the glades of the forest
and the eastern districts of London. The example
set by Mr. Day was followed by other ship, boat, and
barge builders, but of late years, more particularly by
the mast and block makers, riggers, shipwrights, and
shipyard labourers; and more recently still by the
licensed victuallers. Finding the custom good for
trade, the publicans formed a society for building or
hiring these boats on wheels, which, covered with
flags, and provided each with a band of music and
filled with revellers, annually make their progress
into Hainault Forest. They go no longer, alas! to
Fairlop Oak&mdash;for that is numbered with the things
of the past&mdash;but now to Barking side, where, at the
Maypole Inn, the festivities of Fairlop Fair are still
kept up.</p>

<p>These ship and boat cars attract immense multitudes
along the Mile End, Bow, and Whitechapel
Roads, down as far as Aldgate; the crowd assemble
in the morning to see the holiday people start on
their expedition. The most remarkable sight, however,
is at night, when the "boats" return lighted
with coloured lanterns, red and green fires, &amp;c.; and
at every public-house along the road similar fires are
burnt, and brass bands stationed to strike up as the
cars pass, and stop at certain favoured establishments
"for the good of the house." Anxious to witness the
fading glories of Fairlop Friday myself, before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
advancing tide of civilization shall have done their
inevitable work upon them, I sallied forth to the East
End, and walking along one of the finest approaches
to London, from Aldgate, by Whitechapel, to Bow
and Stratford Churches, succeeded in realizing more
completely than ever before two facts: first, how
gigantic is the population of the East End of
London; and, secondly, how little is required to
amuse and attract it. There were only two of the
"boats" sent to the Forest that year. Their return
could gratify the sight of these people but for a single
instant; yet there, from early dusk almost to succeeding
daylight, those working men, literally "in
their thousands"&mdash;and not in the Trafalgar Square
diminutive of that expression&mdash;gathered to gratify
themselves with the sight of the pageant. In comparison,
the "B&oelig;uf Gras," which annually sends the
gamins of Paris insane, is really a tasteful and refined
exhibition. Yet there they were, women, men, and
children&mdash;infants in arms, too, to a notable extent&mdash;swarming
along that vast thoroughfare, boozing outside
the public-houses, investing their pence in
"scratch-backs" and paper noses, feathers and decorations,
as do their betters on the course at Epsom,
under the feeble excuse of "waiting for the boats."
The first arrived en retour at Stratford Church
about ten o'clock; and certainly the appearance of
the lumbering affair as it moved along, with its
rigging brought out by means of coloured fires, lan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>terns,
and lamps, was odd enough. As soon as it
passed me at Stratford, I jumped outside one of the
Bow and Stratford omnibuses, and so had an opportunity
of following, or rather joining in, the procession
as far as Whitechapel, where the "boat" turned
off into Commercial Road. For the whole of that
space the footway was filled with one seething mass of
humanity, and the publicans were driving a rattling
trade outside and inside their establishments. As the
glare of the coloured fires lighted up the pale faces of
the crowd with a ghastly hue, and I heard the silly
and too often obscene remarks bandied between the
bystanders and the returning revellers, I could not
help agitating the question, whether it would not be
possible to devise some innocent recreation, with a
certain amount of refinement in it, to take the place
of these&mdash;to say the best&mdash;foolish revelries. In point
of fact, they are worse than foolish. Not only was it
evident that the whole affair from beginning to end,
as far as adults were concerned, was an apotheosis of
drink; but amongst another section of the populace,
the boys and girls, or what used to be boys and
girls&mdash;for, as the Parisians say, "Il n'y a plus de
gar&ccedil;ons"&mdash;one must have been blind indeed not to see
the mischief that was being done on those East End
pavements; done more thoroughly perhaps, certainly
on a vastly larger scale, than in the purlieus of the
forest. It is an uninviting subject to dwell upon;
but one could understand all about baby farms, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Lock Hospitals, and Contagious Diseases Acts, out
there that July night, in the crowded streets of East
London.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to dilate upon these evils, and
not to mention an organization which, for the last
ten years, has been seeking to remedy the mischief.
Some hundreds of working men of a more serious
stamp, aided by a few gentlemen and ministers of
various denominations, form themselves into small
bands of street preachers, and sallying forth in a body,
hold services and preach sermons at the most populous
points of the Fairlop route. Being curious to
see the effect of their bold labours&mdash;for it requires immense
"pluck" to face a Whitechapel mob&mdash;I joined
one of these detachments, where the Rev. Newman
Hall was the preacher. Before starting, this gentleman
gave it as the result of his long experience with
the British workman that there is no use in waiting
for him to come to church. If the church is to do
anything with him, it must go out and meet him in
the streets and fields, as it originally did. Mr. Hall
gave some amusing illustrations of his experience at
Hastings, where, for several weeks, he had been
preaching on the beach to large congregations. He
was idling there, he said, for health's sake, and one
evening, seeing a number of men loafing about, he
proposed to one of them that he should give them an
address. This gentleman declined the address, but
added, characteristically enough, "If ye'll gie me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
some beer I'll drink it." Two others, being asked if
they would listen, "didn't know as they would."
Under these unpromising auspices Mr. Hall began,
and, attracting a crowd, was "moved on" by a policeman.
A gentleman who recognised him proposed an
adjournment to the beach, and there a sermon was
preached, and has been repeated by Mr. Hall on
several occasions, with a congregation of thousands.
He has a peculiar knack of speaking in a tongue
"understanded of the people," and his address to the
Fairlop crowd on that Friday night "told" considerably.
At its conclusion he quietly put on his hat,
dropped into the crowd, and went his way; but the
tone of criticism amongst his hearers was very
favourable, and I quite agree with the critics that it's
a pity we haven't "more parsons like that." It is
not, however, simply by religious zeal such a want as
that to which I allude is to be supplied, but by the
substitution of some sensible recreation for the low
attractions of the beershop and gin-palace. It is a
problem worthy of our deepest thinkers: "What shall
we offer our huge populations in exchange for the
silly pageant even now being enacted in the outskirts
of the metropolis&mdash;which may well be taken to embody
the pastime of the lower orders&mdash;Fairlop Fair?"</p>

<h3>A CHRISTMAS DIP.</h3>


<p>There are few more exhilarating things, on a breezy
spring morning, than a spurt across that wonderful
rus in urbe&mdash;Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park&mdash;for
a prospective dip in the Serpentine, where, at
specified hours every morning and evening, water-loving
London is privileged to disport itself in its
congenial element. So congenial is it, in fact, that
some enthusiastic individuals do not limit themselves
to warm summer mornings, or the cooler ones of
springtide and autumn, but bathe all the year round&mdash;even,
it is said, when a way for their man&oelig;uvres
has to be cut through the ice. Skirting the north
bank of the Serpentine at morning or evening in the
summer, the opposite shore appears absolutely pink
with nude humanity, the younger portion dancing
and gambolling very much after the manner of
Robinson Crusoe's cannibals. The bathers occasionally
look a great deal better out of their integuments
than in them. Not from this class, however,
do your all-the-year-round bathers come. The Arab
is an exotic&mdash;a child of the Sun, loving not to disport
himself in water the temperature of which shocks his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
tentative knuckles, as he dips them in the unaccustomed
element. His wardrobe, again, is too much
after the fashion of that pertaining to Canning's
needy knife-grinder to make an al fresco toilette
other than embarrassing. From the all-the-year-round
bathers, as a nucleus, there has grown up,
within the last few years, the Serpentine Swimming
Club; and on Christmas-day in the morning they
have an annual match open to all comers&mdash;though, it
need scarcely be said, patronized only by those whom,
for brevity's sake, we may term all-rounders.</p>

<p>Now, I had often heard of this Christmas-day
match, and as often, on Christmas-eve, made up my
mind to go; but the evening's resolution faded away,
as such resolutions have only too often been known to
do, before the morning's light. This year, however&mdash;principally,
I believe, because I had been up very
late the previous night&mdash;I struggled out of bed before
dawn, and steered for the Serpentine. A crescent
moon was shining, and stars studded the clear spaces
between ominous patches of cloud. A raw, moist
wind was blowing, and on the muddy streets were
evident traces of a recent shower. I had no notion
that the gates of Kensington Gardens were open so
early; and the sensation was novel as I threaded the
devious paths in morning dawn, and saw the gas still
alight along the Bayswater Road. A solitary thrush
was whistling his Christmas carol as I struggled over
the inundated sward; presently the sun threw a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
red streaks along the East, over the Abbey Tower;
but, until I had passed the Serpentine Bridge, not a
single human being met my gaze. There, however,
I found some fifty men, mostly with a "sporting"
look about them. The ubiquitous boy was there,
playing at some uncomfortable game in the puddles
round the seats. The inevitable dog stood pensively
by the diving board; and when, by-and-by straggling
all-rounders came and took their morning header, the
quadruped rushed after them to the very edge of the
water, as though he had been a distinguished member
of the Humane Society. He shirked the element
itself, however, as religiously as though he had been
one of London's great unwashed. In the pause
which preceded the race, I learned, from the
Honorary Secretary of the Serpentine Swimming
Club, particulars of its history and of the race itself.
For six years it had been merely a club race; but last
year it was thrown open. Strangely enough the race
had never been won twice by one man, though the
competitors had been pretty much the same every
year. I also conversed with one of the intending
competitors, who showed me on his breast with
pardonable pride, five medals of the Royal Humane
Society, awarded for saving life in cases of danger
from drowning. The wearer was a Professor of
Natation, and told me that, among his pupils, he had
an old lady sixty-seven years of age, who had just
commenced, and was able to swim some twenty yards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
already. The brave old lady's example may do good;
though it is to be hoped that she may not, at her
time of life, be compelled to exert her art for her own
protection.</p>

<p>Names were now called, and fourteen competitors
presented themselves&mdash;a motley group, clad for the
most part in trousers, horse-rug, and wide-awake, or,
more simply still, in Ulster frieze coat only. The
group of spectators had by this time grown to some
hundreds, nearly all directly interested in the noble
art; and the dips became fast and frequent. Two
flags were placed in the water at the distance of
100 yards from the diving board; on this slender
platform fourteen shivering specimens of humanity
ranged themselves, and at the word of the starter
plunged into the water with that downward plunge
so incomprehensible to the uninitiated. A short,
sharp struggle followed, the competitors swimming
with the sidelong movement and obstreperous puffing
which likens the swimmer so closely to the traditional
grampus. Eventually one of the group is seen
heading the others, and breasting the water with
calm and equable stroke in the old-fashioned style.
He reaches the flag a full yard before his nearest
antagonist. Numbers two and three, following, are
about half a yard apart. The others come in pretty
much in a group. All were picked men, and there
were no laggards. The names of the winners were
as follows:&mdash;1. Ainsworth; 2. Quartermain; 3. H.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Coulter. The time occupied in the race was 1 min.
24 sec. Immediately after the race there was a rapid
re-assumption of rugs and Ulsters, though some of
the more hardy walked about in the garb of Nature,
making everybody shiver who looked at them.
Finally, the prizes, consisting of three handsome
medals, were distributed by Mr. H. Bedford, who
stood on a park seat and addressed a few genial
words to each of the successful candidates; then, with
a cheer, and frequent wishes for a Merry Christmas,
the assembly resolved itself into its component parts.</p>

<p>I had taken my accustomed cold tub before coming
out, yet each of these fourteen devoted men appeared
to me as a hero. They were not Herculean individuals:
several of them were mere youths. Some
of the all-rounders were grey-headed men, but there
was about them all a freshness and ruddiness which
showed that their somewhat severe regimen agreed
with them. Fresh from such a Spartan exhibition,
everything seemed very late and Sybaritic in my
domestic establishment, and I could not help revolving
in my mind the question, what would one of
these hardy all-the-year-rounders think of me if he
knew I was ever guilty of such a malpractice as
breakfast in bed? It is a novel method; but there
are many worse ways of inaugurating the Great Holiday
than by taking&mdash;what it had been a novel sensation
for me even to witness&mdash;a Christmas Dip in the
Serpentine.</p>

<h3>BOXING-DAY ON THE STREETS.</h3>


<p>Boxing-day in the London streets, and especially a
wet Boxing-day, can scarcely fail to afford us some
tableaux vivants illustrative of English metropolitan
life. In a metaphorical and technical sense, Boxing-day
is always more or less "wet"&mdash;generally more,
and not less; but this year the expression is used
climatically, and in its first intention. Christmas-eve
of the year about which I write was bright and
springlike; Christmas-day dismal, dark, and un-Christmas-like;
but Boxing-day that year was essentially
muggy, sloppy, drizzly, and nasty. A day to
avoid the London streets if you want to take a
romantic Rosa-Matilda view of London life; but the
very day of all others, if you wish to see real London
as it is. Boxing-day will inevitably be "wetter" in
every sense than usual this year, internally and externally.
So let us commence our series of living
pictures at ten o'clock in the morning. Suppose we
begin with something that shall bear reference to the
past festival&mdash;the eve and the day of the Great Birth,
recollect. See, here is Grotto Passage, Marylebone,
and at its extremity Paradise Street&mdash;the names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sound promising, but alas for the reality! We are
going to turn for a moment into the Marylebone
Police Court, where Mr. D'Eyncourt is dispensing
summary justice to the accumulations of the last two
days. These are the people who have been spending
Christmas-eve, Christmas-day, and some portion of
Boxing-day already in the police-cells. Let us take
one as a typical case. Let that poor little eight-year-old
Arab step down from the dock and go off with his
mother, who, we hope, will take the magistrate's excellent
advice, and keep the child from begging&mdash;that
is why he has spent Christmas in the cells&mdash;lest he
be sent to a school for eight years, and she have to
pay for him&mdash;God help her! she does not look as
though she could afford very high terms. A bruised
and bleeding woman, not young or good-looking,
enters the box with her head bound up. Her lord
and master confronts her in the dock. It is the "old,
old story." A drop of drink yesterday&mdash;the day of
the Great Nativity, never forget&mdash;series of "drops of
drink" all day long; and, at five o'clock, just when
gentility was beginning to think of dinner, the kitchen
poker was used with frightful effect. A triangular
cut over the right eye, and another in the dangerous
neighbourhood of the left ear, administered with that
symbol of domestic bliss, the kitchen poker, sends the
wife doubled up into a corner, with an infant of two
years old in her arms. The head of the family goes
out for a walk after his exertions. The woman lies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
there bleeding until the neighbours hear her "mourning,"
as she terms it&mdash;the result being that the lord
and master's "constitutional" is cut short by a policeman,
and the happy pair are this morning separated
for six months, at the expiration of which period
Paterfamilias is to find surety for another six months'
good behaviour. Such, starred round with endless
episodes of "drunk and disorderly," "foul language,"
and so on, is our first tableau this Boxing-day. It is
not a pleasant one. Let us pass on.</p>

<p>Along Oxford Street, despite the Bank Holidays
Act, many shops are open, chiefly those devoted to
the sale of articles eatable, drinkable, and avoidable;
these last being in the shape of chemists' shops, and
shops for Christmas presents&mdash;to be shunned by
miserly old bachelors. Let us turn into the British
Museum and see sensible, decorous Boxing-day there.
At the corner of Museum Street there is a lively itinerant
musician, evidently French, who plays the fiddle
until his bow tumbles all to pieces, but he goes on
playing with the stick as though nothing had happened.
When his instrument has come entirely to
grief he turns to a clarionet, which he carries under
his arm, and plays "Mourir pour la Patrie" with
extraordinary vocal effect and irreverent gestures.
Punch-and-Judy is largely attended at the other end;
Punch is kitchen-pokering his wife, too, like the gentleman
we have just left; but we pass in with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
crowds to the Museum itself. Halting a moment in
the reading-room, to jot down there a few notes, one
is struck with the scanty show of students. <i>They</i>
are spending Boxing-day somewhere else. Passing
through the little knot of people who are permitted
by special order to come as far as the door of the
reading-room, and who evidently regard the readers
as some curious sort of animal exhibited for their
special delectation&mdash;perhaps the book-"worm" of
which they have heard so much&mdash;we go up the stairs,
now thronged with crowds in unwonted broadcloth
and fragrant with the odour of the inevitable orange.
Next to the drinking fountain, which is decidedly the
chief attraction, comes the gorilla, and then the
extinct animals. One stout old lady, contemplating
the megatherium and mastodon, inquires in what
parts "them creeturs" are to be found, and seems
considerably damped by being informed that Nature
has been "out" of such articles for several &aelig;ons. The
mummies, with the bones of their toes sticking out,
also come in for a large share of admiration. There
is a good deal of rough flirtation going on; but, on
the whole, the pleasure is rather of a placid order,
though still contrasting favourably with the settled
gloom visible on the faces of the attendants in the
various galleries. How well we can understand such
gloom! How utterly hateful must that giant elk
and overgrown extinct armadillo be to a man con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>demned
to spend a lifetime in their close contemplation!</p>

<p>But let us pass on to the artistic Boxing-day
keepers at the National Gallery. The walk will take
us through the Seven Dials, and can scarcely fail to
be suggestive. It is now one o'clock, the traditional
hour of dinner; and in Broad Street, St. Giles's, I see,
for the first time to-day, the human barometer evidently
standing at "much wet." A gentleman in a
grey coat and red comforter, who bears palpable signs
of having been more than once on his back, has just
reached that perplexing point of inebriety when he
can walk quickly or run, but cannot stand still or
walk steadily. He is pursued by small children,
mostly girls, after whom, every now and then, he runs
hopelessly, to their intense gratification. The poultry
and bird shops in the Seven Dials are objects of some
attraction, though they savour too much of "business"
to be in very great force. The National Gallery is
crowded with unaccustomed art students. There is
about the visitors a quiet air of doing their duty, and
being determined to go through with it at any price.
One brazen-faced quean speculates audibly&mdash;in fact,
very audibly&mdash;as to which "picter" she should choose
if she had her "pick," and decent matrons pass the
particularly High Art of the old masters with half-averted
gaze, as though they were not quite sure of
doing right in countenancing such exhibitions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Hogarth's evergreen "Marriage &agrave; la Mode" is a great
centre of attraction, and the youngsters never tire of
listening, as "with weeping and with laughter still is
the story told" over and over again by their elders.
Gainsborough's likeness of Mrs. Siddons is also a great
favourite; but perhaps the picture that attracts most
attention is Van Eyck's "John Arnolfini, of Lucca,
and his Wife." The gentleman wears a portentous
hat, which tickled the fancy of the Boxing-day people
immensely. There were great speculations too among
them as to whether the curious Tuscan pictures at the
top of the stairs were "needlework" or not. Still,
who shall say that these visitors were not the better
for their visit, surrounded as they were by forms of
beauty on every side, even if they did not examine
them with the eyes of connoisseurs?</p>

<p>Boxing-day on the river: The silent street is almost
deserted. There is no rush for the Express boat to-day.
It is literally the streets&mdash;muddier and sloppier
than the Thames itself&mdash;that are the attraction. Some
little boys are making the trip from Westminster to
London Bridge as a treat; and it is an intense joke
with them to pretend to be dreadfully seasick.
Boxing-day in the City is synonymous with stagnation.
It is a howling wilderness, with nobody to howl.
On the Metropolitan Railway I verily believe travellers
were tripping it like the little boys on board the
penny boat. And so theatre time draws on, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
interest of Boxing-day grows to a climax. Soon after
five o'clock groups furtively collect outside the playhouses,
half-ashamed of being so early, but gathering
courage from numbers to form the disorderly queue,
so unlike that of a Parisian theatre. Boxing-night in
the theatres others will describe. It is too much to
expect of one whose mission has been the whole day
long on the streets.</p>

<h3>THE VIGIL OF THE DERBY.</h3>


<p>In those days&mdash;happily now gone by&mdash;when public
strangulation was the mode in Merry England, there
was always an evident fascination appertaining to the
spot where, on the morrow, some guilty wretch was
to expiate his crimes on the gallows. Long before
the erection of that elegant apparatus commenced,
and generally on a Sunday evening, when decent
citizens had newly come from houses of God, where
they had heard the message of life, crowds began to
collect on that central spot in the heart of the great
City dedicated to sudden and violent death. The
coming event seemed to cast its shadow before; and
throughout the night the roisterer or belated traveller
made a d&eacute;tour to visit the human shambles. I confess
to having felt the attraction. I could not then
bring myself to be present at the strangulation
proper; so, as the nearest approach to a "sensation,"
sometimes visited Newgate on the eve of the victim
elect's last morrow. In the same way, being unfortunate
enough to be London-bound on the day of our
great annual holiday, and having heard graphic accounts
of the Downs on the eve of the Derby, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
determined that year, as I could not go to the race
by day, to visit the racecourse by night. Let me own
the soft impeachment: I am not a racing man&mdash;not
in any degree "horsey." When I do go to the Derby
it is to see the bipeds rather than the quadrupeds; to
empty the hamper from Fortnum and Mason's, rather
than to study the "names, weights, and colours of the
riders" on the "c'rect card." If you prefer to have
the sentiment in Latin&mdash;and there is no doubt Latin
does go much farther than English&mdash;I am not one of
those "quos pulverem Olympicum collegisse juvat,"
except in so far that "homo sum; nihil humanum
alienum a me puto." It was to see humanity under
a new aspect, I took the last train to Epsom on the
eve of the Derby.</p>

<p>In order to combine business with pleasure, and
economy with both, I took a third-class ticket at
Victoria, and was fortunate enough to find a compartment
already partially occupied by a nigger
troupe. In this, which under ordinary circumstances
I should have avoided, I took my seat, and was
regaled all the way down with choice morceaux from
the r&eacute;pertoire of my musical friends. The "talking
man" of the party, too, enlivened the proceedings by
anxiously inquiring of the porters at the different
stations what they would take in the way of refreshment,
and issuing unlimited orders to imaginary
waiters on their behoof. It was a strange sensation,
being whirled away from home and bed down to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
wild heath towards midnight; and as we neared our
destination, the air began to "bite shrewdly," and
the sky to look uncommonly like rain&mdash;a contretemps
which would have been fatal to my proposed experience.
We had to change carriages at Sutton, and
here a sociable Aunt-Sally-man, struggling under the
implements of his craft, sought to beguile me from
my African friends by offers of a shake-down in his
tent, with which he proposed to walk across from
Ewell and erect, instead of journeying on to Epsom.
My Ethiopian friends jumped at the proposal, and
forthwith fraternized with Aunt Sally. I determined
to follow out my previous plans; so having drunk to
our next merry meeting, we parted, ostensibly until
to-morrow, but, I fear, for ever.</p>

<p>I had been led to expect "high jinks" at Epsom&mdash;a
sort of Carnival in the quiet town. Nothing could
have been farther from the truth. The town, so far
as outward semblance went, was almost as quiet as
ever. A few sporting men thronged the bar of the
principal hotel, and stragglers hung about the low
beer-shops; but there was nothing at all to indicate
the imminence of the great event. So I fell back on
my usual expedient of applying to the executive, and
found not only an active and intelligent but exceedingly
civil sergeant of police, to whom I told my
errand. He was pleased with the novelty of the idea,
and as he happened to be then going the round of
the town previously to visiting the course, I cast in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
my lot with him for the night. We first visited what
he termed the "German Opera," on Epsom Common.
This is an encampment of organ-grinders, hurdy-gurdy-players,
German bands, &amp;c., who pitch
their tents here instead of going to the Downs.
It was, however, rather late when we reached the
spot where these artists were bivouacking, and they
had retired for the night, so we could not form much
idea of them beyond their numbers, which seemed
considerable, and their odour, which was unfragrant.
Thence we passed down a short alley to a railway
arch, which was aglow with many fires, and rang
with the sounds of many voices. Bidding me make
no observation, whatever might be said, and requesting
me to try and look like an officer in plain clothes,
my cicerone led me into the strange arcade, which I
certainly could not have entered without his protection.
Hundreds of men, women, and boys were
gathered in groups round coke fires, some partaking
of coffee, others singing, the majority sleeping. After
satisfying himself that the fires were legitimate ones,
and not composed of broken fences, my guide left this
teeming hive unmolested. We then steered for the
course, not by the high road, but skirting it along
the fields. The policeman, like myself, carried a stout
stick, which really seemed to be endowed with creative
powers that night. Wherever he poked that
staff&mdash;and he did poke it everywhere&mdash;a human being
growled, or snored, or cursed. Every bush along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hedgerow bore its occupant&mdash;often its group of four
or five, sometimes a party of a dozen or a score. One
shed filled with carts yielded at least a hundred,
though the sergeant informed me it must have been
already cleared several times that evening, as he had
a file of men along the road, besides a cordon inside
the Park palings, which border a great portion of it.
It is with these palings the tramps chiefly do mischief,
pulling them down to make fires along their
route. Wherever my guide found these, he trampled
the fires remorselessly out, and kicked the burning
embers over the sleepers in a manner that must have
been uncomfortable. The men submitted in comparative
silence; but the ladies&mdash;where there happened
to be any&mdash;exerted the privilege of their sex,
and treated us to some choice specimens of the vernacular.
In one case, a female cried out that he was
kicking the fire over the "childer;" and, sure enough,
we found half-a-dozen little ones huddled up asleep.
The policeman remonstrated with her for bringing
them to such a place; but she informed us it was to
"make their living." In what way, she did not add.
To us, it seemed very much like reversing the process,
and causing their death. Fancy young children
camping out on the road to the Downs at midnight!
Boys of thirteen and fourteen abounded, sleeping in
large groups along the hedgerows, and sometimes out
in the open fields, where the dew lay thick.</p>

<p>At length, after many windings, we reached the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Downs. The white booths, following the direction of
the course in their sinuous lines, looked like stately
white marble streets and crescents in the dim, uncertain
light of that hour which, between May 31
and June 1, is neither day nor night. Under the
stands and around the booths, tabernacling beneath
costermongers' barrows, and even lying out openly
sub dio, were still the hundreds of human beings. In
one small drinking booth was a sight the policeman
said he had never seen equalled in his twenty years'
experience. A long, narrow table ran down the
centre, with benches on each side. The table itself
was occupied with recumbent figures; on the benches
the sleepers sat, bending forward over it, and under
the benches sleepers sprawled upon the grass. The
whole of the front of the booth was open, and exposed
to the biting wind; but there they snored as
calmly as though on eider-down. We climbed the
steps of the stand above the ring, and waited for
the day, which slowly broke to the song of the
lark and nightingale over that strange scene. With
the first suspicion of dawn the sleepers awoke and
got up; what for I cannot imagine. It was barely
two o'clock, and how they were going to kill the
next twelve hours I could not guess. Rise they did
however, and an itinerant vendor of coffee, who
was literally up with the lark, straightway began to
drive a roaring trade. I saw no stronger drink than
this consumed; nor did I witness a single case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
drunkenness during the whole night. But this was
before the Derby! At this juncture we were all surprised
by the apparition of a hansom-lamp toiling up
the hill. Two adventurous gentlemen from Liverpool,
it appeared, had arrived at the Euston Station, and
insisted upon being driven at once to an hotel on
Epsom Downs. The Jehu, secure of a fabulous fare,
drove them accordingly; and, of course, had to drive
them back again to Epsom&mdash;the hotels on the Downs
quietly but firmly declining to be knocked up at that
untimely hour even by gentlemen from Liverpool.
As the sun showed his first up-slanting rays above the
horizon, with the morning star hanging impertinently
near, the two gipsy encampments began to exhibit
signs of life. The Zingari encamp exclusively by
themselves, and some picturesque specimens of the
male sex, looking remarkably like the lively photograph
of the Greek brigands, showed themselves on
the outskirts. The ladies reserved themselves for
later in the day. My guide cautioned me not to
attempt to enter the encampment, as the men are
dangerous, and their position on the Downs a privileged
one. It was only when the tramps were trespassing,
or evidently bent on mischief, that they were
disturbed. On the Downs they were monarchs of all
they surveyed.</p>

<p>When the sun was fairly up, and the morning
mists rolled away from those glorious Downs, I felt
my mission accomplished. I had seen the sun rise on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Epsom course. As it was many hours before a train
would return, and I still felt fresh, I resolved to give
the coup de grace to my night's adventure by walking
home&mdash;at least, walking to the radius of workmen's
trains. The vanguard of the Derby procession now
began to show strongly in the shape of the great unwashed
climbing the ridge of the hill by the paddock;
and I felt I should see some characteristic sights
along the road. Bidding good-bye, therefore, to my
guide at Epsom, I set out on foot along the now-populous
road, mine being the only face turned
London-wards. Carts laden with trestles and boards
for stands now began to be in force. By-and-by the
well-known paper bouquets and outrageous head-gear
showed themselves as forming the cargo of costermongers'
carts. The travellers were all chatty, many
of them chaffy. Frequent were the inquiries I had to
answer as to the hour and the distance to the course.
Occasionally a facetious gentleman anxiously inquired
whether it was all over, as I was returning? I believe
the majority looked upon me as a harmless
lunatic, since I was travelling away from Epsom on
the Derby morning, and pitied me accordingly. An
Irishman aptly illustrated the genial character of
Hibernian chaff as compared with English. "Good
day to your honner!" he said. "It does me good to
see your honner's happy face again;" though, of
course, he had never seen it before. As I passed on
with a brief salutation, he took the trouble to run after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
me, and slapping me on the shoulder, added, in a
beautiful brogue: "Wait a minnit; I don't want to
ax you for anything, but only to tell you how glad I
am to see yer honner's happy face agin. Good
mornin'!"</p>

<p>So through Ewell, Cheam, and Morden, up to
Tooting; the throng increasing at every mile. At
Balham, finding no train for an hour, I footed it
again. I found preparations for endless Aunt Sally
already being made on Clapham Common. Soon after
six, I jumped into a train on the London, Chatham,
and Dover, and came home "with the milk;" having
not only had a healthy night's exercise&mdash;for the
weather had all along been splendid&mdash;but having
added to my experiences of London life one new
"wrinkle" at least: I had seen the life of St. Giles's
kitchen and Bethnal Green lodging-house &agrave; la campagne.
What I had already seen under the garish
candlelight of the Seven Dials and Commercial Road
I saw gilded into picturesqueness by that glorious
and never-to-be-forgotten sunrise on Epsom Downs
which ushered in the Derby Day.</p>

<h3>THE WIFESLAYER'S "HOME."</h3>


<p>There is something very weird and strange in that
exceptional avocation which takes one to-day to a
Lord Mayor's feast or a croquet tournament, to-morrow
to a Ritualistic service, next day to the home
of a homicide. I am free to confess that each has its
special attractions for me. I am very much disposed
to "magnify my office" in this respect, not from any
foolish idea that I am "seeing life," as it is termed,
but still from a feeling that the proper study of mankind
<i>is</i> man in all his varied aspects.</p>

<p>It need not always be a morbid feeling that takes
one to the scene of a murder or other horrible event,
though, as we well know, the majority of those who
visit such localities do go out of mere idle curiosity.
It may be worth while, however, for some who look
a little below the surface of things, to gauge, as it
were, the genius loci, and see whether, in the
influences surrounding the spot and its inhabitants
there be anything to afford a clue as to the causes of
the crime.</p>

<p>In summing up the evidence concerning a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
tragedy at Greenwich, where a man killed his wife by
throwing a knife, the coroner "referred to the horrible
abode&mdash;a coal cellar&mdash;in which the family, nine in
number, had resided, which was unfit for human
habitation, and ought to have been condemned by
the parish authorities." Having seen and described
in these pages something of how the poor are
housed in the cellars of St. Giles's and Bethnal Green,
and traced the probable influences of herding together
the criminal and innocent in the low lodging-houses,
it occurred to me to visit the scene of this awful
occurrence, and see how far the account given before
the coroner's jury was correct.</p>

<p>With this view I took the train to Greenwich, and,
consulting the first policeman I met, was by him
directed to Roan Street as the scene of the tragedy.
Roan Street I found to be a somewhat squalid by-street,
running out of Skelton Street, close&mdash;it seemed
significantly close&mdash;to the old parish church. One
could not help thinking of the familiar proverb, "The
nearer the church, the farther from God." The actual
locality is called Munyard's Row, being some dozen
moderate-sized houses in Roan Street, let out in
lodgings, the particular house in question being again,
with a horrible grotesqueness, next door but one to a
beer-shop called the "Hit or Miss!" I expected to
find Roan Street the observed of all observers, but the
nine days' wonder was over since what Dickens called
the "ink-widge." Indeed, a homicide has ceased to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
be a nine days' wonder now. This only happened on
Saturday; and when I was there, on the following
Wednesday, Roan Street had settled down into its
wonted repose. A woman with a child was standing
on the door-step, and, on my inquiring if I could see
the kitchen, referred me to Mrs. Bristow at the
chandler's shop, who farms the rent of these populous
tenements; for Munyard's Row is peopled "from
garret to basement," and a good way underground
too.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bristow, a civil, full-flavoured Irishwoman,
readily consented to act cicerone, and we went through
the passage into the back garden, where all the poor
household furniture of the homicide's late "home"
was stacked. It did not occupy a large space, consisting
only of the bedstead on which the poor woman
sat when the fatal deed was done, two rickety tables,
and two chairs. These were all the movables of a
family of nine. The mattress was left inside&mdash;too
horrible a sight, after what had taken place, to be
exposed to the light of day.</p>

<p>We passed&mdash;Honora Bristow and myself&mdash;with a
"gossip" or two, who had come to see what I was
after, into the back kitchen, for the wifeslayer had two
rooms en suite, though the family elected to occupy
only one. The floor of this apartment was either
mother earth, or, if flagged, so grimed with filth as
to be a very fair resemblance of the soil. Here stood
only that terrible memento, the drenched mattress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
In the front kitchen&mdash;which, let me state, would have
been palatial in comparison with the Seven Dials or
Spitalfields, had it been only clean&mdash;there was very
little light, for the window, which was well down
below the surface of the pavement, had not a whole
pane in it, and the broken ones had been stuffed up
with old rags which were very protuberant indeed.
That window alone would show that the m&eacute;nage had
not been a judicious one.</p>

<p>"He was a quiet man," said Honora, "and gave
trouble to no one. He and his wife never had a
word." The gossips all believed that the story of
the throwing the knife was true, notwithstanding the
medical evidence went against it. The boy of twelve,
who provoked the father to throw the knife, was evidently
the incubus of the wretched home. "Almost
before the breath was out of his mother, that boy was
searching about the bed to see if he could find any
ha'pence," said Honora. That boy was evidently not
satisfactory. His evidence was refused by the Coroner,
because he could not read or write. But then what
had been the child's surroundings? They have been
described above. The man himself had a patriarchal
family of seven, from a girl of seventeen down to a
baby of two, and all, as we have seen, slept in one
room, though there were two, and though a bucket
of whitewash would have made the pair habitable,
besides giving the lad some useful employment.</p>

<p>The father was of no particular occupation, picking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
up odd jobs, and leaning largely to the shrimp trade.
He stood high in Honora Bristow's regards as having
regularly paid his 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a week for five years, or,
at least, being some 5<i>s.</i> behind now; a sum which
will probably be covered by the chattels in the back
garden. The poor home was silent then. The mother
lay calmly in the dead-house, after the post-mortem
examination, "terrible cut and hacked about," said
the one gossip who had ventured to go and see her
quondam friend. The father was in Maidstone Gaol.
The little children were being taken care of by the
grandmother until such time as the mother should have
been buried, when they would gravitate to the workhouse.</p>

<p>In the meantime the boy, &aelig;t. twelve, the cause of
all the mischief, disports himself in Munyard's Row
as though nothing had happened. Perhaps he is the
most difficult part of the problem; but the whole
question of the home is a puzzling one. The boy is
evidently the product of the home. It very much
concerns the community that such produce should
become extinct; and therefore the sooner some improvements
can be introduced into such homes the
better. In the first place, there is decidedly too little
light. Sunshine, under any circumstances, would
have been impossible there. The advisability of
human beings burrowing underground may be questioned,
whether in cellars or genteel underground
kitchens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Then again, one bedroom&mdash;nay, one bedstead&mdash;for
father, mother, and seven children ranging from
seventeen to two is decidedly deficient. This sounds
almost too horrible to be true; but I was careful to
ascertain that the eldest girl, though in domestic
service in Greenwich, slept at the "home." More
horrible still is the fact disclosed, that they had a
second room, yet had not the decency to use it.
"De mortuis nil nisi bonum." They lived according
to their light; but they had very little light, literally
or figuratively. Surely we want to teach our poor
the simple rules of hygiene. One of the gossips, a
clean, healthy little woman, with a fine baby at her
breast, referred with pride to her poor kitchen, identical
in all respects, save dirt, with the home.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was one thing that struck me
forcibly, and that was the sort of qualified reprobation
with which these good gossips&mdash;really decent people
in their way&mdash;spoke of the habit of throwing knives.
Honora had once thrown one at her daughter of
eighteen, but never meant to do so again. And all
this under the bells of the old parish church of
Greenwich in the year of grace 1870!</p>

<p>Clearly, however, the first question is what to do
with the boy, &aelig;t. twelve. Comporting himself as he
did in the face of the awful tragedy he had caused,
this young gentleman must clearly not be lost sight
of, or it will be the worse for himself and those with
whom he is brought into contact. Nay, in a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
years, he will become a centre of influence, and
radiate around him another such "home," worse,
perhaps, than the first.</p>

<p>Let our Social Science so far break through the
programme it may have laid down as to touch on this
very appropriate subject of squalid homes, and its
next sitting may be a very useful one indeed.</p>

<h3>BATHING IN THE FAR EAST.</h3>


<p>Visions of Oriental splendour and magnificence float
across the imagination at the mere mention of the
storied East. Soaring above all the routine of ordinary
existence and the commonplaces of history, that
creative faculty within us pictures Pactolus with its
golden sands; or recalls from the legendary records
of childhood the pomp of Aladdin's Princess going to
her luxurious bath; or brings back to mind the almost
prosaic minuteness with which the Greek poet describes
the bath of Ulysses when he returned from
his wanderings. In the East the bath has ever been
an institution&mdash;not merely a luxury, but a necessity;
and it is a proof of the eclectic tendencies of our
generation that we have domesticated here in the
West that great institution, the Hammam, or Turkish
bath, which the Romans were wise enough to adopt,
after their Eastern experience, more than two thousand
years ago. Of none of these Oriental splendours,
however, has the present narrative to tell. I ask
those interested in social questions to take a very
early Sunday expedition to the East End of London,
and catch a glimpse of those whom, after what I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
have to relate, it would be libel to call the "Great
Unwashed." We will look at East London engaged
in the interesting process of performing its ablutions.</p>

<p>Very enjoyable is a Saturday afternoon stroll in
Victoria Park. Those gentlemen of London who sit
at home at ease are apt to think of the East End as
a collection of slums, with about as much breathing
space for its congregated thousands as that supplied
to the mites in a superannuated Cheshire cheese. Let
us pass through Bethnal Green Road, and, leaving
behind the new Museum, go under a magic portal
into the stately acres which bear the name of our
Sovereign. On our right is the Hospital for Diseases
of the Chest, of which the foundation-stone was laid
by the Prince Consort, and the new wing of which
our Orientals hope one day to see opened by her
Majesty in person. Most convincing test of all is
the situation of this Consumptive Hospital&mdash;showing
the salubrity of the Eastern breezes. Inside the imposing
gate the visitor will find extensive cricket-grounds
interspersed with broad pastures, whose flocks
are the reverse of Arcadian in hue. Cricket-balls
whiz about us like shells at Inkermann; and the
suggestive "Thank you" of the scouts forces the
passer-by into unwonted activity as he shies the
ball to the bowler. Then there are roundabouts
uncountable, and gymnasia abundant. There are
bosquets for the love-makers, and glassy pools,
studded with islands innumerable, over which many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a Lady of the Lake steers her shallop, while Oriental
sailor-boys canoe wildly along. There are flower-beds
which need not blush to be compared with Kew
or the Crystal Palace. But it is not with such that
we are now concerned. On one of those same lakes
over which, on Saturday evening, sailors in embryo
float their mimic craft&mdash;and one young gentleman,
slightly in advance of the rest, directs a very miniature
steamship&mdash;we see boards suggesting that daily,
from four to eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the Orientals may immerse
themselves in the limpid and most tempting waters.
The depth, they are paternally informed, increases
towards the centre, buoys marking where it is six
feet; so that our Eastern friends have no excuse for
suicide by drowning.</p>

<p>East London birds are early birds, and to catch
them at their bath you must be literally up with the
lark. Towards six o'clock is the most fashionable
hour for our metropolitan Pactolus; and, as it is
some miles distant from what can, by any stretch of
courtesy, be called the West End, and as there are no
workmen's trains on a Sunday morning, a long walk
or cab drive is inevitable for all who would witness
the disporting of our amphibious Orientals. Rising
thus betimes on a recent "Sunday morning before
the bells did ring," I sped me to the bathing pond,
judiciously screened off by shrubs from the main path.
It was between the appointed hours that I arrived;
and, long before I saw anything, the ringing laughter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the young East reached me through the shrubs.
Threading the path which led to the lake, I found
the water literally alive with men, boys, and
hobbledehoys, revelling in the water like young
hippopotami on the Nile. Boys were largely in the
ascendant&mdash;boys from ten to fifteen years of age
swam like young Leanders, and sunned themselves on
the bank, in the absence of towels, as the preparative
to dressing, or smoked their pipes in a state of nature.
It is only just to say that while I remained, I heard
little if any language that could be called "foul."
Very free and easy, of course, were the remarks, and
largely illustrative of the vulgar tongue; not without
a share of light chaff directed against myself, whose
presence by the lake-side puzzled my young friends.
I received numerous invitations to "peel" and have a
dip; and one young urchin assured me in the most
patronizing way possible that he "wouldn't laugh at
me" if I could not get on. The language may not
have been quite so refined as that which I heard a
few days before from the young gentlemen with tall
hats and blue ties at Lord's; but I do say advisedly
that it would more than bear comparison with that of
the bathers in the Serpentine, where my ears have
often been assailed with something far worse than
anything I heard in East London. In the matter of
clothes, too, the apparel of our young friends was indeed
Eastern in its simplicity; yet they left it unprotected
on the bank with a confidence that did honour to our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
common humanity in general, and to the regulations
of Victoria Park in particular. Swimming in some
sort was almost universal among the bathers, showing
that their visit to the water was not an isolated event
in their existence, but a constant as it is a wholesome
habit. The Oriental population were for the most
part apparently well fed; and one saw there lithe and
active frames, either careering gracefully along in the
old style of swimming, or adopting the new and
scientific method which causes the human form divine
to approach very nearly to the resemblance of a rather
excited grampus.</p>

<p>But inexorable Time warns the youthful bathers
that they must sacrifice to the Graces; and some
amusing incidents occur during the process. Generally
speaking, though the amount of attire is not
excessive, considerable effort in the way of pinning
and hitching is required to get things in their proper
places. A young gentleman was reduced to inexpressible
grief, and held up to the scorn of his fellow-bathers,
by the fact that, in the course of his al fresco
toilette, one of his feet went through his inexpressibles
in an honourable quarter, instead of proceeding
by the proper route; the error interested his friends
vastly&mdash;for they are as critical as the most fastidious
could be of any singularity in attire, and they held
the unfortunate juvenile in his embarrassing position
for a long time, to his intense despair, until he was
rescued from his ignoble position by some grown-up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
friend. Then, the young East is prone to the pleasures
of tobacco. It was, I presume, before breakfast
with most of the bathers, and smoking under those
conditions is a trial even to the experienced. Some,
pale from their long immersion&mdash;for theirs was no
transient dip&mdash;grew paler still after they had discussed
the pipe or cigar demanded of them by rigorous
custom. Fashion reigns supreme among the gamins
of the East as well as among the ladies of the West.
Off they went, however, cleaner and fresher than
before&mdash;tacitly endorsing by their matutinal amusement
the motto that has come down from the philosopher
of old, and even now reigns supreme from
Bermondsey to Belgravia, that "water is a most
excellent thing."</p>

<p>The day may arrive perhaps when, having embanked
the Thames, we shall follow suit to the Seine
and the Rhine, by tenanting it with cheap baths for
the many. Until we do so, the stale joke of the
"Great Unwashed" recoils upon ourselves, and is no
less symptomatic of defective sanitary arrangements
than the possibility of a drought in Bermondsey.
But we are forgetting our bathers. They have gone,
leaving the place to solitude&mdash;some, I hope, home to
breakfast, others out among the flower-walks or on the
greensward. It is a gloomy, overcast, muggy, unseasonable
July morning; and the civil attendant by the lake-side
tells me that the gathering has not been so large
as usual. The young Orientals&mdash;as is the custom of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
their race&mdash;love sunshine. They get little enough of
it, Heaven knows. The next bright Sunday morning,
any one who happens to be awake between the hours
mentioned, and who would like to add to his experiences
of metropolitan existence, may do a worse
thing, and see many a less pleasant sight, than if he
hailed a hansom and drove by the principal entrance
of Victoria Park to our Eastern Bath.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>AMONG THE QUAKERS.</h3>


<p>There is no more engaging or solemn subject of contemplation
than the decay of a religious belief. Right
or wrong, by that faith men have lived and died,
perhaps for centuries; and one cannot see it pass out
from the consciousness of humanity without something
more than a cursory thought as to the reasons
of its decadence. Being led by exceptional causes to
take a more than common interest in those forms of
belief which lie beyond the pale of the Church of
England, I was attracted by a notice in the public
journals that on the following morning the Society of
Friends would assemble from all parts of England
and open a Conference to inquire into the causes
which had brought about the impending decay of
their body. So, then, the fact of such decay stood
confessed. In most cases the very last persons to
realize the unwelcome truth are those who hold the
doctrines that are becoming effete. Quakerism must,
I felt, be in a very bad condition indeed when its own
disciples called together a conference to account for
its passing away. Neither men nor communities, as
a rule, act crowner's 'quest on their own decease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
That faith, it was clear, must be almost past praying
for which, disbelieving, as our modern Quietism does,
the efficacy of assemblies, and trusting all to the
inward illumination of individuals, should yet summon
a sort of Quaker &OElig;cumenical Council. I thought
I should like to probe this personal light myself, and
by inquiring of one or two of the members of the
body, learn what they thought of the matter. I was
half inclined to array myself in drab, and <i>tutoyer</i> the
first of the body I chanced to encounter in my walks
abroad. But then it occurred to me how very seldom
one did meet a Quaker nowadays except in the
"month of Maying." I actually had to cast about
for some time before I could select from a tolerably
wide and heterogeneous circle of acquaintance two
names of individuals belonging to the Society of
Friends; though I could readily remember half a
dozen of every other culte, from Ultramontanes down
to Jumpers. These two, at all events, I would
"interview," and so forestall the Conference with a
little select synod of my own.</p>

<p>It was possible, of course, to find a ludicrous side
to the question; but, as I said, I approached it
seriously. Sydney Smith, with his incorrigible habit
of joking, questioned the existence of Quaker babies&mdash;a
position which, if proven, would, of course, at once
account for the diminution of adult members of the
sect. It was true I had never seen a Quaker infant;
but I did not therefore question their existence, any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
more than I believed postboys and certain humble
quadrupeds to be immortal because I had never seen
a dead specimen of either. The question I acknowledged
at once to be a social and religious, not a
physiological one. Why is Quakerism, which has
lived over two hundred years, from the days of George
Fox, and stood as much persecution as any system of
similar age, beginning to succumb to the influences
of peace and prosperity? Is it the old story of Capua
and Cann&aelig; over again? Perhaps it is not quite
correct to say that it is now beginning to decline; nor,
as a fact, is this Conference the first inquiry which
the body itself has made into its own incipient decay.
It is even said that symptoms of such an issue showed
themselves as early as the beginning of the eighteenth
century; and prize essays have been from time to
time written as to the causes, before the Society so
far fell in with the customs of the times as to call a
council for the present very difficult and delicate inquiry.
The first prize essay by William Rountree
attributes the falling off to the fact that the early
Friends, having magnified a previously slighted
truth&mdash;that of the Indwelling Word&mdash;fell into the
natural error of giving it an undue place, so depriving
their representations of Christian doctrine of the symmetry
they would otherwise have possessed, and influencing
their own practices in such a way as to
contract the basis on which Christian fellowship rests.
A second prize essay, called "The Peculium," takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a still more practical view, and points out in the
most unflattering way that the Friends, by eliminating
from their system all attention to the arts,
music, poetry, the drama, &amp;c., left nothing for the
exercise of their faculties save eating, drinking, and
making money. "The growth of Quakerism," says
Mr. T. Hancock, the author of this outspoken essay,
"lies in its enthusiastic tendency. The submission
of Quakers to the commercial tendency is signing
away the life of their own schism. Pure enthusiasm
and the pursuit of money (which <i>is</i> an enthusiasm)
can never coexist, never co-operate; but," he adds,
"the greatest loss of power reserved for Quakerism is
the reassumption by the Catholic Church of those
Catholic truths which Quakerism was separated to
witness and to vindicate."</p>

<p>I confess myself, however, so far Quaker too that
I care little for the written testimony of friends or
foes. I have, in all my religious wanderings and inquiries,
adopted the method of oral examination; so I
found myself on a recent November morning speeding
off by rail to the outskirts of London to visit an
ancient Quaker lady whom I knew very slenderly,
but who I had heard was sometimes moved by the
spirit to enlighten a little suburban congregation, and
was, therefore, I felt the very person to enlighten
me too, should she be thereunto moved. She was a
venerable, silver-haired old lady, clad in the traditional
dress of her sect, and looking very much like a living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
representation of Elizabeth Fry. She received me
very cordially; though I felt as if I were a fussy innovation
of the nineteenth century breaking in upon
the sacred, old-fashioned quiet of her neat parlour.
She "thee'd and thou'd" me to my heart's content:
and&mdash;to summarize the conversation I held with her&mdash;it
was to the disuse of the old phraseology and the
discarding of the peculiar dress that she attributed
most of the falling off which she was much too shrewd
a woman of the world to shut her eyes to. These
were, of course, only the outward and visible signs of
a corresponding change within; but this was why
the Friends fell off, and gravitated, as she confessed
they were doing, to steeple-houses, water-dipping, and
bread-and-wine-worship. She seemed to me like a
quiet old Prophetess Anna chanting a "Nunc
Dimittis" of her own on the passing away of her
faith. She would be glad to depart before the glory
had quite died out. She said she did not hope much
from the Conference, and, to my amazement, rather
gloried in the old irreverent title given by the Independents
to her forefathers from their "quaking and
trembling" when they heard the Word of God, though
she preferred still more the older title of "Children
of the Light." She was, in fact, a rigid old Conservative
follower of George Fox, from the top of her
close-bordered cap to the skirts of her grey silk gown.
I am afraid my countenance expressed incredulity as
to her rationale of the decay; for, as I rose to go, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
said, "Thou dost not agree, friend, with what I have
said to thee&mdash;nay, never shake thy head; it would be
wonderful if thou didst, when our own people don't.
Stay; I'll give thee a note to my son in London,
though he will gainsay much of what I have told
thee." She gave me the letter, which was just what
I wanted, for I felt I had gained little beyond a pleasant
experience of old-world life from my morning's
jaunt. I partook of her kindly hospitality, was
shown over her particularly cosy house, gardens, and
hothouses, and meditated, on my return journey,
upon many particulars I learnt for the first time as to
the early history of Fox; realizing what a consensus
there was between the experiences of all illuminati.
I smiled once and again over the quaint title of one
of Fox's books which my venerable friend had quoted
to me&mdash;viz., "A Battle-door for Teachers and Professors
to learn Plural and Singular. <i>You</i> to <i>Many</i>,
and <i>Thou</i> to <i>One</i>; Singular, One, <i>Thou</i>; Plural, Many,
<i>You</i>." While so meditating, my cab deposited me at
the door of a decidedly "downy" house, at the West
End, where my prospective friend was practising in I
will not mention which of the learned professions.
Both the suburban cottage of the mother and the
London m&eacute;nage of the son assured me that they had
thriven on Quakerism; and it was only then I recollected
that a poor Quaker was as rare a personage as
an infantile member of the Society.</p>

<p>The young man&mdash;who neither in dress, discourse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
nor manner differed from an ordinary English gentleman&mdash;smiled
as he read his mother's lines, and, with
a decorous apology for disturbing the impressions
which her discourse might have left upon me, took
precisely the view which had been latent in my own
mind as to the cause of the Society's decay.
Thoroughly at one with them still on the doctrine of
the illuminating power of the Spirit in the individual
conscience, he treated the archaic dress, the obsolete
phraseology, the obstinate opposition to many innocent
customs of the age, simply as anachronisms. He
pointed with pride to the fact that our greatest living
orator was a member of the Society; and claimed for
the underlying principle of Quakerism&mdash;namely, the
superiority of a conscience void of offence over written
scripture or formal ceremony&mdash;the character of being
in essence the <i>broadest</i> creed of Christendom. Injudicious
retention of customs which had grown
meaningless had, he felt sure, brought down upon the
body that most fatal of all influences&mdash;contempt.
"You see it in your own Church," he said. "There
is a school which, by reviving obsolete doctrines and
practices, will end in getting the Church of England
disestablished as it is already disintegrated. You see
it even in the oldest religion of all&mdash;Judaism. You
see, I mean, a school growing into prominence and
power which discards all the accumulations of ages,
and by going back to real antiquity, at once brings
the system more into unison with the century, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prevents that contempt attaching to it which will
accrue wherever a system sets its face violently
against the tone of current society." He thought
the Conference quite unnecessary. "There needs no
ghost come from the dead to tell us that, Horatio,"
he said, cheerily. "They will find out that Quakerism
is not a proselytizing religion," he added; "which, of
course, we knew before. They will point to the
fashionable attire, the gold rings, and lofty chignons
of our younger sisters as direct defiance of primitive
custom. I am unorthodox enough"&mdash;and he smiled
as he used that word&mdash;"to think that the attire is
more becoming to my younger sisters, just as the
Society's dress is to my dear mother." That young
man, and the youthful sisters he told me of, stood as
embodied answers to the question I had proposed to
myself. They were outward and visible evidences of
the doctrine of Quaker "development." The idea is
not dead. The spirit is living still. It is the spirit
that underlies all real religion&mdash;namely, the personal
relation of the human soul to God as the source of
illumination. That young man was as good a Quaker
at heart as George Fox or William Penn themselves;
and the "apology" he offered for his transformed
faith was a better one than Barclay's own. I am
wondering whether the Conference will come to anything
like so sensible a conclusion as to why Quakerism
is declining.</p>

<h3>PENNY READINGS.</h3>


<p>Who has ever penetrated beneath the surface of
clerical society&mdash;meaning thereby the sphere of
divinities (mostly female) that doth hedge a curate
of a parish&mdash;without being sensible of the eligibility
of Penny Readings for a place in Mystic London?
When the Silly Season is at its very bathos; when
the monster gooseberries have gone to seed and the
showers of frogs ceased to fall; after the matrimonial
efforts of Margate or Scarborough, and before the
more decided business of the Christmas Decorations,
then there is deep mystery in the penetralia of every
parish. The great scheme of Penny Readings is
being concocted, and all the available talent of the
district&mdash;all such as is "orthodox" and "correct"&mdash;is
laid under contribution.</p>

<p>It is true to a proverb that we English people have
a knack of doing the best possible things in the worst
possible way; and that not unfrequently when we do
once begin doing them we do them to death. It
takes some time to convince us that the particular
thing is worth doing at all; but, once persuaded, we
go in for it with all our British might and main.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
The beard-and-moustache movement was a case in
point. Some years ago a moustache was looked upon
by serious English people as decidedly reckless and
dissipated. A beard was fit only for a bandit. Nowadays,
the mildest youth in the Young Men's
Christian Association may wear a moustache without
being denounced as "carnal," and paterfamilias revels
in the beard of a sapeur, no misopogon daring to say
him nay. To no "movement," however, does the
adage "Vires acquirit eundo" apply more thoroughly
than to that connected with "Penny Readings."
Originally cropping up timidly in rustic and suburban
parishes, it has of late taken gigantic strides, and
made every parish where it does <i>not</i> exist, rural or
metropolitan, very exceptional indeed. There was a
sound principle lying at the bottom of the movement,
in so far as it was designed to bring about a fusion of
classes; though, perhaps, it involved too much of an
assumption that the "working man" had to be lectured
to, or read to, by his brother in purple and fine
linen. Still the theory was so far sound. Broad
cloth was to impart to fustian the advantages it possessed
in the way of reading, singing, fiddling, or
what not; and that not gratuitously, which would
have offended the working man's dignity, but for the
modest sum of one penny, which, whilst Lazarus was
not too poor to afford, Dives condescended to accept,
and apply to charitable purposes.</p>

<p>Such being, in brief, the theory of the Penny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Reading movement, it may be interesting to see how
it is carried out in practice. Now, in order to ascertain
this, I availed myself of several opportunities
afforded by the commencement of the Penny Reading
season, which may be said to synchronize very nearly
with the advent of London fogs, and attended the
opening of the series in several widely different localities.
In describing my experiences it would perhaps
be invidious to specify the exact locality where they
were gathered. I prefer to collate those experiences
which range from Campden Hill to Camden Town
inclusive. Amid many distinguishing traits there
are common elements traceable in all, which may
enable us to form some estimate of the working of the
scheme, and possibly to offer a few words of advice to
those interested therein.</p>

<p>In most cases the Penny Readings are organized
by the parochial clergy. We will be orthodox, and
consider them so to be on the present occasion. In
that case, the series would probably be opened by the
incumbent in person. Some ecclesiastical ladies,
young and middle-aged, who, rightly or wrongly,
believe their mission is music, and to whom the
curate is very probably an attraction, aid his efforts.
Serious young men read, and others of a more mundane
turn of mind sing doleful "comic" songs, culled
from the more presentable of the music-hall r&eacute;pertoire.
In many cases skilled amateurs or professionals lend
their valuable assistance; and it is not too much to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
say that many a programme is presented to the
audience&mdash;ay, and faithfully carried out too&mdash;which
would do credit to a high-priced concert-room. But,
then, who make up the audience? Gradually the
"penny" people have been retiring into the background,
as slowly but as surely as the old-fashioned
pits at our theatres are coyly withdrawing under
the boxes to make way for the stalls. The Penny
Readings have been found to "draw" a higher class
of audience than those for whom they were originally
intended. The curate himself, if unmarried, secures
the whole spinsterhood of the parish. His rendering
of the lines, "On the receipt of my mother's picture
out of Norfolk," is universally acknowledged to be
"delightful;" and so, in course of time, the Penny
Readings have been found to supply a good parochial
income; and the incumbent, applying the proceeds
to some local charity, naturally wishes to augment
that income as much as possible. The consequence
is that the penny people are as completely nowhere
at the Penny Readings as they are in the free seats
at their parish church. The whole of the body of
the room is "stalled off," so to say, for sixpenny
people, and the penny folk are stowed away anywhere.
Then, again, in several programmes I have been at
the pains to analyse, it is palpable that, whilst the
bulk of the extracts fire over the heads of the poor
people, one or two are inserted which are as studiously
aimed at them as the parson's remarks in last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sunday's sermon against public-house loafing. Still
"naming no names," I attended some readings where
one of the clergy read a long extract from Bailey's
"Festus," whilst he was succeeded by a vulgar fellow,
evidently put in for "the gods," who delivered himself
of a parody on Ingoldsby, full of the coarsest
slang&mdash;nay, worse than that, abounding in immoralities
which, I hope, made the parochial clergy sit
on thorns, and place the reader on their "Index
Expurgatorius" from henceforth.</p>

<p>Excellent in its original design, the movement is
obviously degenerating into something widely different.
First, I would say, Let your Penny Readings
be really Penny Readings, and not the egregious
<i>lucus a non</i> they now are. If there is any distinction,
the penny people should have the stalls, and then, <i>if
there were room</i>, the "swells" (I must use an offensive
term) could come in for sixpence, and stand at the
back. But there should be no difference at all. Dives
and Lazarus should sit together, or Dives stop away
if he were afraid his fine linen may get soiled. Lazarus,
at all events, must not be lost sight of, or treated
to second best. The experiment of thus mingling
them has been tried, I know, and succeeds admirably.
Dives and Lazarus <i>do</i> hobnob; and though the
former occasionally tenders a silver coin for his
entr&eacute;e, he does not feel that he is thereby entitled to
a better seat. The committee gets the benefit of his
liberality; and when the accounts are audited in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
spring, Lazarus is immensely pleased at the figure his
pence make. Then, again, as to the quality of the
entertainment. Let us remember Lazarus comes
there to be elevated. That was the theory we set out
with&mdash;that we, by our reading, or our singing, or
fiddling, or tootle-tooing on the cornet, could civilize
our friend in fustian. Do not let us fall into the
mistake, then, of descending to his standard. We
want to level him up to ours. Give him the music
we play in our own drawing-rooms; read the choice
bits of fiction or poetry to his wife and daughters
which we should select for our own. Amuse his poor
little children with the same innocent nonsense with
which we treat our young people. Above all, don't
bore him. I do not say, never be serious, because it
is a great mistake to think Lazarus can only guffaw.
Read "The Death of Little Nell" or of Paul Dombey,
and look at Mrs. Lazarus's eyes. Read Tom Hood's
"Song of the Shirt," and see whether the poor seamstress
out in the draughty penny seats at the back
appreciates it or not. I did hear of one parish at the
West End&mdash;the very same, by the way, I just now
commended for sticking to the "penny" system&mdash;where
Hood's "Nelly Gray," proposed to be read by
the son of one of our best known actors, was tabooed
as "unedifying." Lazarus does not come to be
"edified," but to be amused. If he can be at the
same time instructed, so much the better; but the
bitter pill must be highly gilded, or he will pocket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
his penny and spend it in muddy beer at the public-house.
If the Penny Reading can prevent this&mdash;and
we see no reason why it should not&mdash;it will have had
a mission indeed. Finally, I feel sure that there is in
this movement, and lying only a very little way from
the surface, a wholesome lesson for Dives too; and
that is, how little difference there is, after all, between
himself and Lazarus. I have been surprised to see
how some of the more recherch&eacute; "bits" of our
genuine humorists have told upon the penny people,
and won applause which the stalest burlesque pun or
the nastiest music-hall inanity would have failed to
elicit. Lazarus must be represented on the platform
then, as well as comfortably located in the audience.
He must be asked to read, or sing, or fiddle, or do
whatever he can. If not, he will feel he is being
read at, or sung to, or fiddled for, and will go off to
the Magpie and Stump, instead of bringing missus
and the little ones to the "pa'son's readings." Let
the Penny Reading teach us the truth&mdash;and how true
it is&mdash;that we are all "working men." What matters
it whether we work with head or with hand&mdash;with
brain or muscle?</p>

<h3>DARWINISM ON THE DEVIL.</h3>


<p>It has been said&mdash;perhaps more satirically than
seriously&mdash;that theology could not get on without its
devil. Certain it is that wherever there has been
a vivid realization of the Spirit of Light, there, as if
by way of antithesis, there has been an equally clear
recognition of the Power of Darkness. Ormuzd&mdash;under
whatever name recognised&mdash;generally supposes
his opponent Ahriman; and there have even been
times, as in the prevalence of the Manichean heresy,
when the Evil Spirit has been affected in preference
to the good&mdash;probably only another way of saying
that morals have been held subordinate to intellect.
But I am growing at once prosy and digressive.</p>

<p>The announcement that the "Liberal Social
Union" would devote one of their sweetly heretical
evenings at the Beethoven Rooms, Harley Street, to
an examination of the Darwinian development of the
Evil Spirit, was one not to be scorned by an inquirer
into the more eccentric and erratic phases of theology.
Literary engagements stood in the way&mdash;for the
social heretics gather on a Friday&mdash;but come what
might, I would hear them discuss diabolism. Leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
my printer's devil to indulge in typographical errors
according to his own sweet will (and I must confess
he <i>did</i> wander), I presented myself, as I thought in
good time, at the portals of the Harley Street room,
where his Satanic Majesty was to be heretically anatomized.
But, alas! I had not calculated aright the
power of that particular potentate to "draw." No
sooner had I arrived at the cloak-room than the very
hats and umbrellas warned me of the number of his
votaries. Evening Dress was "optional;" and I
frankly confess, at whatever risk of his displeasure,
that I had not deemed Mephistopheles worthy of a
swallow-tailed coat. I came in the garb of ordinary
life; and at once felt uncomfortable when, mounting
the stairs, I was received by a portly gentleman and
an affable lady in violent tenue de soir. The room
was full to the very doors; and as soon as I squeezed
into earshot of the lecturer (who had already commenced
his discourse) I was greeted by a heterodox
acquaintance in elaborate dress-coat and rose-pink
gloves. Experience in such matters had already told
me&mdash;and thereupon I proved it by renewed personal
agony&mdash;that an Englishman never feels so uncomfortable
as when dressed differently from his compeers
at any kind of social gathering. Mrs. T&mdash;&mdash; asks
you to dinner, and you go clad in the correct costume
in deference to the prandial meal, but find all the rest
in morning dress. Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, on the contrary,
sends you a rollicking note to feed with a few friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&mdash;no
party; and you go straight from office to find a
dozen heavily-got-up people sniggering at your frock
coat and black tie. However, as I said, on this occasion
the lecturer, Dr. Zerffi, was in the thick of what
proved to be a very attractive lecture; so I was not
the observed of all observers for more than two or
three minutes, and was able to give him my whole
attention as soon as I had recovered from my confusion.
Dr. Zerffi said:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Darwin's theory of evolution and selection
has changed our modern mode of studying the
inorganic and organic phenomena of nature, and
investigating the realities of truth. His theory
is not altogether new, having been first proclaimed
by Leibnitz, and followed up with regard to history
by Giovanni Battista Vico. Oken and Goethe amplified
it towards the end of the last, and at the beginning
of the present century. Darwin, however, has systematized
the theory of evolution, and now the
branches of human knowledge can only be advantageously
pursued if we trace in all phenomena,
whether material or spiritual, a beginning and a
gradual development. One fact has prominently
been established, that there is order in the eternal
change, that this order is engendered by law, and
that law and order are the criterions of an all-wise
ruling Spirit pervading the Universe. To this positive
spirit of law a spirit of negation, an element of
rebellion and mischief, of mockery and selfishness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
commonly called the Devil, has been opposed from
the beginning.</p>

<p>It appeared, till very lately, as though God had
created the world only for the purpose of amusing
the Devil, and giving him an abundance of work, all
directed to destroying the happiness of God's finest
creation&mdash;man. Treating the Devil from a Darwinian
point of view, we may assert that he developed himself
from the protoplasm of ignorance, and in the gloomy
fog of fear and superstition grew by degrees into a
formidable monster, being changed by the overheated
imaginations of dogmatists into a reptile, an owl, a
raven, a dog, a wolf, a lion, a centaur, a being half
monkey, half man, till, finally, he became a polite and
refined human being.</p>

<p>Man once having attained a certain state of consciousness,
saw sickness, evil, and death around him,
and as it was usual to assign to every effect some
tangible cause, man developed the abstract notion of
evil into a concrete form, which changed with the
varying impressions of climate, food, and the state of
intellectual progress. To the white man the Devil
was black, and to the black man white. Originally,
then, the Devil was merely a personification of the
apparently destructive forces of nature. Fire was his
element. The Indians had their Rakshas and Uragas,
the Egyptians their Typhon, and the Persians their
Devas. The Israelites may claim the honour of
having brought the theory of evil into a coarse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sensual form, and the Christians took up this conception,
and developed it with the help of the Gnostics,
Plato, and the Fathers dogmatically into an entity.</p>

<p>I shall not enter on a minute inquiry into the
origin of this formidable antagonist of common sense
and real piety; I intend to take up the three principal
phases of the Devil's development, at a period
when he already appears to us as a good Christian
Devil, and always bearing in mind Mr. Darwin's
theory of evolution, I shall endeavour to trace
spiritually the changes in the conceptions of evil
from the Devil of Luther to that of Milton, and at
last to that of Goethe.</p>

<p>The old Jewish Rabbis and theological doctors were
undoubtedly the first to trace, genealogically, the pedigree
of the Christian Devil in its since general form. If
we take the trouble to compare chap. i. v. 27 of Genesis
with chap. ii. v. 21, we will find that two distinct creations
of man are given. The one is different from the other. In
the first instance we have the clear, indisputable statement,
"So God created man in his own image:" and
to give greater force to this statement the text goes
on, "in the image of God created he him; male and
female created he them." Both man and woman were
then created. Nothing could be plainer. But as
though no creation of man had taken place at all, we
find, chap. ii. v. 7: "And the Lord formed man of
the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life." This was evidently a second man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
differently created from the first, who is stated to have
been made "in the image of God himself." This
second creature was entrusted with the nomination
and classification of all created things; that is, with
the formation of language, and the laying down of
the first principles of botany and zoology. After he
had performed this arduous task it happened that
"for Adam there was not found an help meet for
him" (verse 20), and chap. ii. v. 21 tells us, "The
Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and
he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up
the flesh instead thereof;" and verse 22, "And of the
rib which the Lord God had taken from man made
He a woman, and brought her unto man." Adam
then joyfully exclaims (verse 23), "This <i>is</i> now bone
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." This cannot
but lead to the conclusion that this woman was an
altogether different creature from the first. The contradiction
was most ingeniously explained by the
learned Jewish Rabbis, who considered the first woman
the organic germ from which the special Hebrew-Christian
devils were evolved. The Rabbis discovered
that the name of the first woman was
"Lilith"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (the nightly); they knew positively&mdash;and
who can disprove their assertion?&mdash;that she was the
most perfect beauty, more beautiful than Eve; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had long waving hair, bright eyes, red lips and
cheeks, and a charmingly finished form and complexion;
but having been created at the same moment
as the first man, and like him, in the image of God,
she refused to become man's wife; she objected to
being subordinate to the male part of creation&mdash;she
was, in fact, the first strong-minded woman, claiming
the same rights as man, though a woman in body and
form. Under these circumstances the existence of
the human race was deemed to be an impossibility,
and therefore the Lord had to make good his error,
and He created Eve as the completing part of man.
The first woman left her co-equally created male, and
was changed into an enormous, most beautiful, and
seducing "She Devil," and her very thoughts brought
forth daily a legion of devils&mdash;incarnations of pride,
vanity, conceit, and unnaturalness. Happily these
devils were so constituted that they devoured one
another. But in their rage they could take possession
of others, and more especially entered little
children&mdash;boys under three days old, girls under
twenty days&mdash;and devoured them. This myth, by
means of evolution and the law of action and re-action,
engendered the further legend about the existence of
three special angels who acted as powerful antidotes
to these devils, and whose names, "Senoi, Sansenoi,
and Sanmangeloph," if written on a piece of parchment
suspended round the neck of children afforded
certain protection against them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p>The origin of the Devil may thus be traced to the
first vain contempt for the eternal laws of nature.
The woman, refusing to be a woman, engenders
devils; the man, trying to be a God, loses paradise
and his innocence, for the element of the supernatural
intruded upon him and abstracted his thoughts
from this earth. These were the half idealistic and
half realistic elements from which the three greatest
spiritual incarnations of the Evil Spirit sprung up.
Luther took the Evil Spirit as a bodily entity, with
big horns, fiery eyes, a reddish, protruding tongue, a
long tail, and the hoof of a horse. In this latter
attribute we trace at once the Kentaur element of
ancient times. Through nearly one thousand three
hundred years from Tertullian and Thaumaturgus
down to Luther, every one was accustomed to look
upon life as one great battle with tens of thousands
of devils, assaulting, harassing, annoying, and seducing
humanity. All fought, quarrelled, talked,
and wrestled with the Devil. He was more spoken
of in the pulpits of the Christian Churches, written
about in theological and scientific books, than God or
Christ. All misfortunes were attributed to him.
Thunder and lightning, hailstorms and the rinderpest,
the hooping cough and epileptic fits were all the
Devil's work. A man who suffered from madness
was said to be possessed by a legion of Evil Spirits.
The Devil settled himself in the gentle dimples of
a pretty girl with the same ease and comfort as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the wrinkles of an old woman. Everything that was
inexplicable was evil. Throughout the Middle Ages
the masses and the majority of their learned theological
teachers believed the Greek and Latin classics
were inspired by Evil Spirits; that sculptures or
paintings, if beautiful, were of evil; that all cleverness
in Mathematics, Chemistry, or Medicine proved
the presence of the corrupting Evil Spirit working in
man. Any bridge over a chasm or a rapid river was
the work of the Devil; even the most beautiful
Gothic cathedrals, like those of Cologne and St.
Stephen at Vienna were constructed by architects
who served their apprenticeship in the infernal regions.
The Devil sat grinning on the inkstands of
poets and learned men, dictating to the poor deluded
mortals, as the price for their souls, charming love-songs
or deep theological and philosophical essays.
It was extremely dangerous during this period of
man's historical evolution to be better or wiser than
the ignorant masses. Learning, talent, a superior
power of reasoning, love for truth, a spirit of inquiry,
the capacity of making money by clever trading, an
artistic turn of mind, success in life, even in the
Church, were only so many proofs that the soul had
been sold to some dwarfish or giant messenger from
Lucifer, who could appear in a thousand different
forms. Man was, since his assumed Fall, the exclusive
property of the coarse and vulgar conception of
the Evil Spirit. Luther was full of these ideas, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
was brought up in this belief, and though he unconsciously
felt that the Devil ought to be expelled from
our creed, he did not dare to attempt the reform of
humanity by annihilating the mischief-maker: he could
not rob man of his dearest spiritual possession; had
he thought of consigning the Devil to the antediluvian
period of our moral and social formation, he
never could have succeeded in his reform. The Devil,
in fact, was his strongest helpmate; he could describe
the ritual of the Romish Church as the work of the
Evil Spirit, produced to delude mankind. The Devil
had his Romish prayers, his processions, his worship
of relics, his remission of sins, his confessional, his
infernal synods; he was to Luther an active, rough,
and material incarnation of the roaring lion of the
Scriptures in the shape of the Romish Church, walking
about visibly, tangibly, bodily amongst men,
devouring all who believed in the Pope, and who disbelieved
in this stupid phantom of a dogmatically
blinded imagination.</p>

<p>The Evolution-theory may be clearly traced in the
two next conceptions: Milton's Satan and Goethe's
Mephistopheles. They differ as strongly as the periods
and the poems in which they appear. Milton's Satan
loses the vulgar flesh and bone, horn and hoof nature&mdash;he
is an epic character; whilst Goethe's Devil is an
active dramatic entity of modern times. Milton's
representative of evil is a very powerful conception&mdash;it
is evil in abstracto; whilst Mephistopheles is evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in concreto&mdash;the intelligible, tangible Devil, evolved
by the power of selection from an antediluvian
monster, and transformed through a civilizing process
of at least six thousand years into its present form.
Milton's Satan is a debased intellect who in his
boundless ambition is still a supernatural being.
Mephistopheles is the incarnation of our complicated
modern social evils, full of petty tricks and learned
quotations; he piously turns up his eyes, he lies,
doubts, calumniates, seduces, philosophizes, sneers,
but all in a polite and highly educated way; he is a
scholar, a divine, a politician, a diplomatist. Satan is
capable of wild enthusiasm, he sometimes remembers
his bright sinless past; "from the lowest deep," he
yearns, "once more to lift himself up, in spite of fate,
nearer to his ancient seat;"&mdash;he hopes to re-enter
heaven, "to purge off his gloom;" some remnant of
heavenly innocence still clings to him, for, though
<i>fallen</i>, he is still an <i>angel</i>! Mephistopheles in his
real nature is without any higher aspirations, he
argues with a sarcastic smile on his lips, he is ironical
with sophisticated sharpness. Satan has unconsciously
gigantic ideas, he is ready to wrestle with God for
the dominion of heaven. Mephistopheles is perfectly
conscious of his littleness as opposed to our better
intellectual nature, and does evil for evil's sake.
Satan is sublime through the grandeur of his primitive
elements, pride and ambition. Mephistopheles
is only grave in his pettiness; he does not refuse an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
orgie with drunken students, indulges in jokes with
monkeys, works miracles in the witch's kitchen, delights
in the witch's "one-time-one;" distributes little
tracts "to stir up the witch's heart with special
fire." Satan has nothing vulgar in him: he is capable
of melancholy feelings, he can be pathetic and eloquent.
Mephistopheles laughs at the stupidity of the
world, and at his own. Satan believes in God and
in himself, whilst Mephistopheles is the "Spirit that
denies;" he believes neither in God nor in heaven
nor in hell; he does not believe in his own entity&mdash;he
is no supernatural, fantastic being, but man incarnate:
he is the evil part of a good whole, which loses its
entity when once seen and recognised in its real
nature; for Mephistopheles in reality is our own
ignorant, besotted, animal nature, cultivated and developed
at the expense of our intellectual part.</p>

<p>Luther's devil is the outgrowth of humanity in
long-clothes. Man, ignorant of the forces of the
Cosmos, blinded by theological dialectics and metaphysical
subtleties, incapable of understanding the
real essence of our moral and intellectual nature, philosophically
untrained to observe that evil is but a
sequence of the disturbed balance between our double
nature&mdash;spirit and matter&mdash;attributed all mischief in
the intellectual as well as in our social spheres to an
absolute powerful being who continually tormented
him.</p>

<p>Milton's Satan is the poetical conception of man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
developed from an infant in long-clothes into a
boisterous but dreamy youth, ascribing to every incomprehensible
effect an arbitrary, poetical cause.
Goethe's Mephistopheles, lastly is the truthful conception
of evil as it really exists in a thousand forms,
evolved from our own misunderstood and artificially
and dogmatically distorted nature.</p>

<p>Goethe in destroying the Devil as such, consigned
him to the primeval myths and legends of ignorance
and fear, and has shown us the real nature of the evil.</p>

<p>What then is the Devil?</p>

<p>The Devil took, as I said in the beginning, his
origin in our blinded senses, in an undue preponderance
of that which is material in us over that
which is intellectual. The moment we look the Evil
Spirit in the face, he vanishes as an <i>absolute</i> being and
becomes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">A portion of that power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which wills the bad and works the good at every hour.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After having been exposed during several periods
of generations to new conditions, thus rendering a
great amount of variation possible, the Devil has
developed from a monster into a monkey, and from a
monkey into a man endowed with the nature of a
monkey and the propensities of a monster. In the
State and in the Church, in Arts and Sciences, the
Devil is the principle of injustice, hypocrisy, ugliness,
and ignorance. Goethe has annihilated the ideal
poetical grandeur of Milton's Satan; he has stripped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Luther's Devil of his vulgar realism; Goethe has
driven Satan from an imaginary hell, where he preferred
to rule instead of worshipping and serving in
heaven, and with the sponge of common sense he
wiped the horned monster, drawn by the imagination
of dogmatists, from the black board of ignorance. In
banishing the Evil Spirit into the dominion of myths,
Goethe showed him in his real nature. Darwin displaced
man from the exalted pedestal of a special
creation, and endeavoured to trace him as the development
of cosmical elements. Darwin enabled us to
look upon man as the completing link in the great chain
of the gradual evolution of the life-giving forces of
the Universe, and he rendered thus our position more
comprehensible and natural. Goethe, in proving that
the Evil Spirit of ancient and Hebrew-Christian times
was a mere phantom of an ill-regulated fantasy,
taught us to look for the real origin of evil. What
was a metaphysical incomprehensibility became an
intelligible reality. The Demon can be seen in
"Faust" as in a mirror, and in glancing into it we
behold our Darwinian progenitor, the animal,
face to face. Before the times of Goethe, with very
few exceptions, the Evil Spirit was an entity with
whom any one might become familiar&mdash;in fact, the
"spiritus familiaris" of old. The Devil spoke, roared,
whispered, could sign contracts. We were able to
yield our soul to him; and he could bodily enter our
body. The Devil was a corporeal entity. The rack,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
water, and fire were used to expel him from sorcerers
and witches, and to send him into all sorts of unclean
animals. Goethe, in unmasking this phantom, introduced
him not as something <i>without</i>, but as an element
<i>within</i> us. The service rendered to humanity in
showing us the true nature of evil is as grand as the
service rendered by Mr. Darwin in assigning to man
his place <i>in</i> nature, and not <i>above</i> nature. It is
curious that those who have most of the incorrigible
and immovable animal nature in them should protest
with the greatest vehemence and clamour against this
theory. They think by asserting their superiority,
based on a special creation, to become at once special
and superior beings, and prefer this position to trying,
through a progressive development in science and
knowledge, in virtue and honesty, to prove the existence
of the higher faculties with which man has
been endowed through his gradual development from
the lowest phases of living creatures to the highest.
In assuming the Devil to be something absolute and
positive, and not something relative and negative,
man hoped to be better able to grapple with him.
Mephistopheles is nothing personal; he can, like the
Creator himself, be only traced in his works. The
Devil lurks beneath the venerable broadcloth of an
intolerant and ignorant priest; he uses the seducing
smiles of a wicked beauty; he stirs the blood of the
covetous and grasping; he strides through the gilded
halls of ambitious emperors and ministers, who go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with "light hearts" to kill thousands of human
beings with newly-invented infernal machines; he
works havoc in the brains of the vain. The Devil
shuffles the cards for the gambler, and destroys our
peace whether he makes us win or lose on the turf;
he sits joyfully grinning on the tops of bottles and
tankards filled with alcoholic drinks; he entices us
on Sundays to shut our museums and open our gin-palaces;
to neglect the education of the masses; and
then prompts us to accuse them with hypocritical
respectability of drunkenness and stupidity. It is
the Devil who turns us into friends of lapdogs and
makes us enemies of the homeless. The Devil is the
greatest master in dogmatism; he creates sects who,
in the name of love and humility, foster hatred and
pride; the Devil encloses men in a magic circle on
the barren heath of useless speculation; drives them
round and round like blinded horses in a mill, starting
from one point, and after miles and miles of
travel and fatigue, leading us to the point, sadder but
not wiser, from which we set out. The Devil makes
us quarrel whether we ought to have schools with or
without bigoted religious teachings; he burns incense
to stupefy our senses, lights candles to obscure our
sight, amuses the masses with buffooneries to
prevent them from thinking, draws us away from
common-sense morality, and leads us, under the pretext
of a mystic and symbolic religion, to the confessional,
the very hothouse of mischief. Satan in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
his shapes and forms as he rules the world has been
described by Goethe as Egotism. Selfishness is his
element and real nature. Selfishness not yet realizing
the divine, because so entirely <i>humane</i> command&mdash;"Do
unto others as you wish that they should do
unto you." Selfishness is the only essence of evil. Selfishness
has divided men into different nations, and
fosters in them pride, envy, jealousy, and hatred. Mr.
Darwin has shown that one animal preys on the other,
that the weaker species has to yield to the stronger.
Goethe again has shown us how the Evil Spirit drags
us through life's wild scenes and its flat unmeaningness,
to seek mere sensual pleasures and to neglect altogether
our higher and better nature, which is the outgrowth
of our more complicated, more highly developed organization.
Were we only to recognise this, our real
nature, we should leave less to chance and prejudices;
were we to study man from a physiological, psychological,
and honestly historical point of view, we should
soon eliminate selfishness from among us, and be able
to appreciate what is really the essence of evil. The
more nearly we approach Darwin's primitive man, the
ape, the nearer do we draw to the Mephistopheles
who shows us his exact nature with impudent sincerity
in Goethe's "Faust."</p>

<p>That which changes our Psyche, that is our intellectual
faculty with its airy wings of imagination, its
yearnings for truth, into an ugly, submissive, crawling
worm, is heartless selfishness. Not without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
reason is poor guileless Margaret horrified at Mephistopheles.
She shudders, hides herself on the bosom
of Faust, like a dove under the wings of an eagle, and
complains that the Evil Spirit&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... Always wears such mocking grin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half cold, half grim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sees that nought has interest for him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis writ on his brow, and can't be mistaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No soul in him can love awaken.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When all goes wrong, when religious, social, and
political animosities and hatred disturb the peace;
when unintelligible controversies on the inherited sin,
the origin of evil, justification, and transubstantiation,
"grace and free will," the creative and the created,
mystic incantations, real and unreal presences, the
like but not equal, the affirmative and the negative
natures of God and man confuse the finite brains of
infinite talkers and repeaters of the same things;
when they quarrel about the wickedness of the hen
who dared to lay an egg on the Sabbath; when the
glaring torch of warfare is kindled by the fire of petty
animosities, then the Evil Spirit of egotism celebrates
its most glorious festivals.</p>

<p>What can banish this monster, this second and
worse part of our nature? To look upon it from a
Darwinian point of view. Goethe saves his fallen
Faust through useful "occupation," through honest
hard work for the benefit of mankind. The more we
make ourselves acquainted with evil, the last remnant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of our animal nature, in a rational and not mystic
dogmatical sense, the less we exalt ourselves as exceptional
creatures above nature, the easier it must
be for us to dry up the source of superstition and
ignorance which serves to nourish this social monster.</p>

<p>Let our relations to each other be based on "mutual
love," for God is love, and selfishness as the antagonist
of love, and the Devil as the antagonist of God, will
both vanish.</p>

<p>Let us strive to vanquish our unnatural social organization
by a natural, social, but at the same time,
liberal union of all into one common brotherhood, and
the roaring lion will be silenced for ever.</p>

<p>Let us purify society of all its social, or rather unsocial,
iniquities and falsehoods, of all ingratitude and
envy, in striving for an honest regeneration of ourselves,
and through ourselves of humanity at large,
convincing one another that man has developed by
degrees into earth's fairest creature, destined for good
and happiness, and not for evil and wretchedness, and
there will be an end of the <i>Devil</i> and all his <i>devilries</i>.</p>

<h3>PECULIAR PEOPLE.</h3>


<p>In this title, be it distinctly understood, no reference
is intended to those anti-&AElig;sculapian persons who,
from time to time, sacrifice to Moloch among the
Essex marshes. It is not necessary to journey even
as far as Plumstead in search of peculiarity, since the
most manifold and ever-varying types of it lie at one's
very doors. And here, at the outset, without quite
endorsing the maxim that genius is always eccentric,
let it be confessed that a slight deviation from the
beaten track is generally apt to be interesting. When
we see the photograph of some distinguished artist,
musician, or poet, and find the features very like those
of the pork butcher in the next street, or the footman
over the way, we are conscious of a feeling of disappointment
almost amounting to a personal grievance.
Mr. Carlyle and Algernon Swinburne satisfy us.
They look as we feel graphic writers and erotic poets
ought to look. Not so the literary females who affect
the compartment labelled "For ladies only," in the
reading room of the British Museum or on the Metropolitan
Railway. They are mostly like one's maiden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
aunts, and savour far less of the authoress than some
of the charming girls who studiously avoid their exclusive
locale, and evidently use their reading ticket
only to cover with an appearance of propriety a most
unmistakable flirtation. This they carry on sotto voce
with ardent admirers of the male sex, who, though
regular frequenters of the reading room, are no more
literary than themselves. One might pick out a good
many peculiar people from that learned retreat&mdash;that
poor scholar's club room; but let us rather avoid any
such byways of life, and select our peculiars from the
broad highway. Hunting there, Diogenes-wise, with
one's modest lantern, in search&mdash;not of honest&mdash;but
eccentric individuals.</p>

<p>And first of all, having duly attended to the ladies
at the outset, let there be "Place for the Clergy."
There is my dear friend the Rev. Gray Kidds, the
best fellow breathing, but, from a Diogenes point of
view, decidedly eccentric. Gray Kidds is one of those
individuals whose peculiarity it is never to have been
a boy. Kidds at fifteen had whiskers as voluminous
as he now has at six-and-twenty, and as he gambolled
heavily amongst his more puerile schoolfellows,
visitors to the playground used to ask the assistant
masters who that man was playing with the boys.
They evidently had an uneasy notion that a private
lunatic asylum formed a branch of the educational
establishment, and that Gray Kidds was a harmless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
patient allowed to join the boys in their sports. Gray
Kidds was and is literally harmless. He grew up
through school and college, innocently avoiding all
those evils which proved the ruin of many who were
deemed far wiser than himself. He warbled feebly
on the flute, and was adored as a curate, not only for
his tootle-tooings, but for his diligent presence at
mothers' meetings, and conscientious labours among
the poor. A preacher Kidds never pretended to be;
but he had the singular merit of brevity, and crowded
more harmless heresies into ten minutes' pulpit oratory
than Colenso or Voysey could have done in double the
time. The young ladies made a dead set at him, of
course, for Kidds was in every respect eligible; and
he let them stroke him like a big pet lamb, but there
matters ended. Kidds never committed himself. He
is now the incumbent of a pretty church in the
suburbs, built for him by his aunt, and, strange to say,
the church fills. Whether it is that his brevity is attractive,
or his transparent goodness compensates for
his other peculiarities, certainly he has a congregation;
and if you polled that congregation, the one point on
which all would agree, in addition to his eligibility or
innocence, would be that the Rev. Gray Kidds was
"so funny."</p>

<p>And now, for our second type of peculiarity, let us
beat back for one moment to the fair sex again. Mrs.
Ghoul is the reverse of spirituelle; but she is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>thing
more&mdash;she is spiritualistic. She devoutly believes
that the spirits of deceased ancestors come at
her bidding, and tilt the table, move furniture insanely
about, or write idiotic messages automatically. She
is perfectly serious. She does "devoutly" believe this.
It is her creed. It is a comfort to her. It is extremely
difficult to reconcile such a source of comfort
with any respect for one's departed relatives, but that
is Mrs. Ghoul's peculiarity and qualification for a
niche amongst our originals.</p>

<p>Miss Deedy, on the other hand, is ecclesiastical
to the backbone. Miss Deedy ruins her already
feeble health with early mattins (she insists on the
double t) and frequent fasts. Beyond an innocuous
flirtation with the curate at decorations, or a choral
meeting, Miss Deedy has as few sins as most of us
to answer for; but, from her frequent penances, she
might be a monster of iniquity. She is known to
confess, and is suspected of wearing sackcloth. Balls
and theatres she eschews as "worldly," and yet she is
only just out of her teens. She would like to be a
nun, she says, if the habits were prettier, and they
allowed long curls down the back, and Gainsboroughs
above the brow. As it is, Miss Deedy occupies a
somewhat abnormal position, dangling, like Mahomet's
coffin, between the Church and the world. That,
again, is Miss Deedy's peculiarity.</p>

<p>Miss Wiggles is a "sensitive." That is a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
vocation struck out by the prolific ingenuity of the
female mind. Commonplace doctors would simply
call her "hysterical;" but she calls herself magnetic.
She is stout and inclined to a large appetite, particularly
affecting roast pork with plenty of seasoning;
but she passes readily into "the superior condition"
under the manipulations of a male operator. She
makes nothing, save notoriety, by her clairvoyance
and other peculiarities; but she <i>is</i> very peculiar,
though the type of a larger class than is perhaps
imagined in this highly sensational age of ours.</p>

<p>Peculiar boys, too&mdash;what lots of them there are!
What is called affectation in a girl prevails to quite
as large an extent in the shape of endless peculiarities
among boys. A certain Dick (his name is Adolphus,
but he is universally, and for no assignable reason,
known as Dick) rejoices in endorsing Darwinism by
looking and acting like a human gorilla. Dick is no
fool, but assumes that virtue though he has it not.
To see him mumbling his food at meals, or making
mops and mows at the wall, you would think him
qualified for Earlswood; but if it comes to polishing
off a lesson briskly or being mulct of his pudding or
pocket-money, Master Dick accomplishes the polishing
process with a rapidity that gives the lie to his Darwinian
assumption.</p>

<p>Well, they are a source of infinite fun, these eccentrics&mdash;the
comets of our social system. They have,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
no doubt, an object in their eccentricity, a method in
their madness, which we prosaic planetary folks cannot
fathom. At all events, they amuse us and don't
harm themselves. They are uniformly happy and
contented with themselves. Of them assuredly is
true, and without the limitation he appends, Horace's
affirmation, <i>Dulce est desipere</i>, which Mr. Theodore
Martin translates, "'Tis pleasing at times to be
slightly insane."</p>

<h3>INTERVIEWING AN ASTROLOGER.</h3>


<p>For several years&mdash;in fact ever since my first acquaintance
with these "occult" matters whereinto I
am now such a veteran investigator&mdash;my great wish
has been to become practically acquainted with some
Professor of Astral Science. One friend, indeed, I
had who had devoted a long lifetime to this and kindred
subjects, and of whom I shall have to speak
anon; but he had never utilized his knowledge so as
to become the guide, philosopher, and friend of
amorous housemaids on the subject of their matrimonial
alliances, or set himself to discover petty larcenies
for a fee of half-a-crown. He assured me,
however, that the practice of astrology was as rife as
ever in London at this moment, and that businesses
in that line were bought and sold for sterling coin of
the realm, just as though they had been "corner"
publics, or "snug concerns" in the cheesemongery
line. All this whetted my appetite for inquiry, and
seeing one Professor Wilson advertise persistently in
the <i>Medium</i> to the effect that "the celebrated Astrologer
may be consulted on the events of life" from two
to nine <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, I wrote to Professor Wilson asking for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
an interview; but the celebrated astrologer did not
favour me with a reply.</p>

<p>Foiled in my first attempt I waited patiently for
about a year, and then broke ground again&mdash;I will not
say whether with Professor Wilson, or some other
practitioner of astral science. I will call my Archimago
Professor Smith, of Newington Causeway, principally
for the reason that this is neither the real
name nor the correct address. I have no wish to
advertise any wizard gratuitously; nor would it be
fair to him, since, as will be seen from the sequel, his
reception of me was such as to make it probable that
he would have an inconvenient number of applicants
on the conditions observed at my visit.</p>

<p>Availing myself, then, of the services of my friend
above-mentioned, I arranged that we should together
pay a visit to Professor Smith, of Newington Causeway,
quite "permiscuous," as Mrs. Gamp would say.
My companion would go with his own horoscope
already constructed, as he happened to know the exact
hour and minute of his birth&mdash;particulars as to which
I only possessed the vaguest information, which is all
I fancy most of us have; though there was one circumstance
connected with my own natal day which
went a long way towards "fixing" it.</p>

<p>It was on a Monday evening that I visited this
modern Delphic oracle; and, strangely enough, as is
often the case, other events seemed to lead up to this
one. The very lesson on Sunday evening was full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
astrology. It was, I may mention, the story of
the handwriting on the wall and the triumph of
Daniel over the magicians. Then I took up my
Chaucer on Monday morning; and instead of the
"Canterbury Tales," opened it at the "Treatise on the
Astrolabe," which I had never read before, but devoured
then as greedily as no doubt did "Little
Lowis," to whom it is addressed. All this tended to
put me in a proper frame of mind for my visit to
Newington; so, after an early tea, we took my friend's
figure of his nativity with us, and went.</p>

<p>Professor Smith, we found, lived in a cosy house
in the main road, the parlours whereof he devoted to
the purposes of a medical magnetist, which was his
calling, as inscribed upon the wire blinds of the
ground floor front. We were ushered at once into
the professor's presence by a woman who, I presume,
was his wife&mdash;a quiet respectable body with nothing
uncanny about her. The front parlour was comfortably
furnished and scrupulously clean, and the
celebrated Professor himself, a pleasant elderly gentleman,
was sitting over a manuscript which he read
by the light of a Queen's reading lamp. There was
not, on the one hand, any charlatan assumption in
his get-up, nor, on the other, was there that squalor
and neglect of the decencies of life which I have
heard sometimes attaches to the practitioners in
occult science. Clad in a light over-coat, with
spectacles on nose, and bending over his MS.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Professor Smith might have been a dissenting parson
en d&eacute;shabille "getting off" his Sunday discourse, or a
village schoolmaster correcting the "themes" of his
pupils. He was neither; he was a nineteenth century
astrologer, calculating the probabilities of success
for a commercial scheme, the draft prospectus of
which was the document over which he pored. As
he rose to receive us I was almost disappointed to
find that he held no wand, wore no robe, and had no
volume of mystic lore by his side. The very cat that
emerged from underneath his table, and rubbed itself
against my legs was not of the orthodox sable hue,
but simple tabby and white.</p>

<p>My friend opened the proceedings by producing
the figure of his nativity, and saying he had come to
ask a question in horary astrology relative to a certain
scheme about which he was anxious, such anxiety
constituting what he termed a "birth of the mind."
Of course this was Dutch to me, and I watched to
see whether the Professor would be taken off his
guard by finding he was in presence of one thoroughly
posted up in astral science. Not in the least; he
greeted him as a brother chip, and straightway the
two fell to discussing the figure. The Professor
worked a new one, which he found to differ in some
slight particulars from the one my friend had brought.
Each, however, had worked it by logarithms, and
there was much talk of "trines" and "squares" and
"houses," which I could not understand; but even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>tually
the coveted advice was given by the Professor
and accepted by my friend as devoutly as though it
had been a response of the Delphic oracle itself. The
business would succeed, but not without trouble, and
possibly litigation on my friend's part. He was to
make a call on a certain day and "push the matter"
a month afterwards; all of which he booked in a
business-like manner. This took a long time, for the
Professor was perpetually making pencil signs on the
figure he had constructed, and the two also discussed
Zadkiel, Raphael, and other astrologers they had
mutually known. Continual reference had to be
made to the "Nautical Almanack;" but by-and-by
my friend's innings was over and mine commenced.
I have said that I did not know the exact hour and
minute of my birth, and when, with appropriate
hesitation, I named the 1st of April as the eventful
day, the Professor looked at me for a moment with a
roguish twinkle of the eye as though to ascertain
that I was not poking fun at him. I assured him,
however, that such was the inauspicious era of my
nativity, and moreover that I was born so closely
on the confines of March 31&mdash;I do not feel it
necessary to specify the year&mdash;as to make it almost
dubious whether I could claim the honours of April-Fooldom.
This seemed enough for him&mdash;though he
warned me that the absence of the exact time might
lead to some vagueness in his communications&mdash;and
he proceeded forthwith to erect my figure; which, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the way, looked to me very much like making a
"figure" in Euclid; and I peered anxiously to see
whether mine bore any resemblance to the Pons
Asinorum!</p>

<p>I feared I had led my philosopher astray altogether
when the first item of information he gave me was
that, at about the age of twenty-one, I had met with
some accident to my arm, a circumstance which I
could not recall to memory. Several years later I
broke my leg, but I did not tell him that. Going
further back, he informed me that about the age
of fourteen, if I happened to be apprenticed, or in
any way placed under authority, I kicked violently
over the traces, which was quite true, inasmuch as I
ran away from school twice at that precise age, so
that my astrologer scored one. At twenty-eight I
married (true), and at thirty-two things were particularly
prosperous with me&mdash;a fact which I was also
constrained to acknowledge correct. Then came a
dreadful mistake. If ever I had anything to do with
building or minerals, I should be very successful. I
never had to do with building save once in my life,
and then Mr. Briggs's loose tile was nothing to the
difficulties in which I became involved. Minerals I
had never dabbled in beyond the necessary consumption
of coals for domestic purposes. I had an uncle
who interested himself in my welfare some years
ago&mdash;this was correct&mdash;and something was going to
happen to my father's sister at Midsummer, 1876.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
This, of course, I cannot check; but I trust, for the
sake of my venerable relation, it may be nothing prejudicial.
I was also to suffer from a slight cold about
the period of my birthday in that same year, and was
especially to beware of damp feet. My eldest brother,
if I had one, he said, had probably died, which was
again correct; and if my wife caught cold she suffered
in her throat, which piece of information, if not very
startling, I am also constrained to confess is quite
true. Then followed a most delicate piece of information
which I blush as I commit to paper. I wished
to marry when I was twenty-one, but circumstances
prevented. Then it was that memories of a certain
golden-haired first love came back through the vista
of memory. I was then a Fellow of my College, impecunious
except as regarded my academical stipend,
so the young lady took advice and paired off with a
well-to-do cousin. Sic transit gloria mundi! We are
each of us stout, unromantic family people now; but
the reminiscence made me feel quite romantic for the
moment in that ground floor front in Newington
Causeway; and I was inclined to say, "A Daniel
come to judgment!" but I checked myself and remarked,
sotto voce, in the vernacular, "Right again,
Mr. Smith!"</p>

<p>Before passing on to analyse me personally he remarked
that my wife's sister and myself were not on
the best of terms. I owned that words had passed
between us; and then he told me that in my cerebral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
development there was a satisfactory fusion of caution
and combativeness. I was not easily knocked over,
or, if so, had energy to get up again. This energy
was to tell in the future. This, I believe, is a very
usual feature of horoscopic revelation. Next year
was to be particularly prosperous. I should travel a
good deal&mdash;had travelled somewhat this year, and was
just now going to take a short journey; but I should
travel a great deal more next year. I own to asking
myself whether this could bear any reference to the
Pontigny Pilgrimage in which I shared this year,
and the possible pilgrimage to Rome next summer,
and also a projected journey to Scotland by the
Limited Mail next Tuesday evening! On the whole,
my astrologer had scored a good many points.</p>

<p>The most marvellous revelation of all yet remains
to be made, however. When we rose to go we each
of us endeavoured to force a fee on Professor Smith,
but nothing would induce him to receive a farthing!
I had got all my revelations, my "golden" memories
of the past, my bright promises of the future free,
gratis, for nothing! It will be evident, then, why I
do not give this good wizard's address lest I inundate
him with gratuitous applicants, and why I therefore
veil his personality under the misleading title of Professor
Smith of Newington Causeway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>A BARMAID SHOW.</h3>


<p>The present age, denounced by some ungenial
censors as the age of shams, may be described by more
kindly critics as emphatically an age of "shows."
Advancing from the time-honoured shows of Flora
and Pomona&mdash;if not always improving on the type&mdash;and
so on from the cattle show, suggestive of impending
Christmas fare, we have had horse shows, dog
shows, and bird shows. To these the genius of
Barnum added baby shows; and, if we are not misinformed,
a foreign firm, whose names have become
household words amongst us, originated, though not
exactly in its present form, the last kind of show
which has been acclimatized in England&mdash;an exhibition
of barmaids. We had two baby shows in one
year&mdash;one at Highbury Barn by Mr. Giovannelli, the
other at North Woolwich Gardens by Mr. Holland;
and it is to the talent of this latter gentleman in the
way of adaptation that we owe the exhibition of
young ladies "practising at the bar." From babies
to barmaids is indeed a leap, reversing the ordinary
process of going from the sublime to the ridiculous,
for while to all but appreciative mammas those infantile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
specimens of humanity savour largely of the ridiculous,
there can be no question that the present generation
of <i>dames de comptoir</i> is a very sublime article indeed.
I do not say this in derision, nor am I among those who
decry the improvements introduced during the last
few years, both into refreshment bars themselves, and
notably into the class of ladies who preside over them.
The discriminating visitor will decidedly prefer to
receive his sandwich and glass of bitter at the hands of
a pretty barmaid rather than from an oleaginous pot-man
in his shirt-sleeves; and the sherry-cobbler acquires
a racier flavour from the arch looks of the Hebe
who dispenses it. If silly young men do dawdle
at the bar for the sake of the sirens inside, and occasionally,
as we have known to be the case, take unto
themselves these same sirens "for better or for worse,"
we can only cite the opinion of well-informed authorities,
that very possibly the young gentlemen in
question might have gone farther and fared worse, and
that it is not always the young lady who has, in such
a case, the best of the bargain.</p>

<p>So, then, the "Grand Barmaid Contest" opened;
and in spite of the very unmistakable appearance put
in by Jupiter Fluvius, a numerous assemblage gathered
in the North Woolwich Gardens to inaugurate a festival
which, whatever else we may think of it, is at all
events sui generis. Prizes to the value of 300<i>l.</i> were
to be presented to the successful candidates, varying
from a purse of twenty sovereigns and a gold watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and chain, down to "a purse of two sovereigns," with
"various other prizes, consisting of jewellery, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Among the conditions it was required, that every
young lady should be over sixteen years of age; that she
should be dressed in <i>plain</i> but <i>good</i> articles of attire,
"in which a happy blending of colours without prominent
display is most suitable;" and it was moreover
stipulated that each "young lady" should "ingratiate
herself with the public in the most affable manner at
her command, without undue forwardness or frivolity,
but still retaining a strict attention to business." No
young lady was permitted to take part in the contest
unless she had been in the refreshment business for
twelve months, and could produce good testimonials of
character.</p>

<p>Upwards of 700 applications were made, out of
which Mr. Holland selected fifty. Whence the
large number of rejections "deponeth sayeth not." Of
these twenty-eight actually put in an appearance at
three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> on the opening day and four were expected
to join in a day or two. Every visitor is provided
with a voting ticket, which he hands to the lady of
his admiration, and which counts towards the prize.
Each young lady also receives 5 per cent. on what
she sells at her bar. The places are awarded by lot;
and, by a freak of fortune, the two most attractive
demoiselles happened to come together. These were
Numbers One and Fourteen. The former young lady&mdash;who
desires to be known by her number only, true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
genius being ever modest&mdash;was certain to stand
Number One in popular esteem; and, if chignons are
taken into account, she ought literally to "head" the
list by a very long way. The room was tastefully
decorated by Messrs. Defries, and an excellent band
enlivened the proceedings. As evening drew on the
meeting grew more hilarious, but there was not the
slightest impropriety of any kind, the faintest approach
thereto leading to immediate expulsion.</p>

<p>Many persons may be disposed to ask, in respect of
such exhibitions, Cui bono? But at all events there
was nothing which the veriest Cato could denounce as
demoralizing. The "young ladies" were all most
modestly attired in "sober livery;" and certainly&mdash;though
comparisons are odious&mdash;not so pressing in
their attentions as we have seen some other young
ladies at Dramatic F&ecirc;tes, or even some d&eacute;vou&eacute;es at
charitable bazaars. If we may judge from the large
numbers that visited North Woolwich, "in spite of
wind and weather," Mr. Holland was likely to reap an
abundant harvest from this latest "idea," excogitated
from his fertile brain. As the babies have had their
"show," and the stronger sex is not likely to be equal
to the task of being exhibited just yet, there seems
only one section of society open to the speculations of
a skilful entrepreneur. Why does not some one, in a
more serious line than Mr. Holland, try what Sydney
Smith calls the "third sex," and open an exhibition
of curates, with a genuine competition for prizes?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
There could be no possible doubt as to the success of
such a display, and the instruction to be derived from
it would be equally beyond question. In the meantime
we have advanced one step towards such a consummation.
The adult human being has taken the
place of the baby; and people evidently like it. Where
will the rage for exhibitions stop? Who can say to
the advancing tide of shows, "Thus far shalt thou go,
and no farther?" Other classes of society will probably
have their turn, and may think themselves fortunate
if they show up as well as Mr. Holland's
"young ladies."</p>

<h3>A PRIVATE EXECUTION.</h3>


<p>I was quietly fiddling away one evening in the Civil
Service band at King's College, as was my custom
while my leisure was larger than at present, when
the gorgeous porter of the college entered with a
huge billet which he placed on my music-stand with
a face of awe. It was addressed to me, and in the
corner of it was written "Order for Execution." The
official waited to see how I bore it, and seemed rather
surprised that I went on with my fiddling, and
smilingly said, "All right." I knew it was an order
from the authorities of Horsemonger Lane Gaol admitting
me to the private execution of Margaret
Waters, the notorious baby-farmer.</p>

<p>If anything is calculated to promote the views of
those who advocate the abolition of capital punishment,
it is the fact of a woman meeting her death at
the hands of the common hangman. There is something
abhorrent, especially to the mind of the
stronger sex, in the idea of a female suffering the
extreme penalty of the law. On the other hand, the
crime for which Margaret Waters suffered&mdash;which is
too much a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre to need recapitulation&mdash;is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
exactly the one that would exile her from the sympathy
of her own sex. Whilst therefore her case
left the broad question much in the same position as
before, we are not surprised to find that strenuous
efforts had been made to obtain a commutation of the
sentence. Mr. Gilpin, Mr. Samuel Morley, and Mr.
Baines had been conspicuous for their efforts in the
cause of mercy. All, however, had been to no purpose.
Margaret Waters was privately executed within the
walls of Horsemonger Lane Gaol at nine o'clock.</p>

<p>It was a thankless errand that called one from one's
bed whilst the moon was still struggling with the
feeble dawn of an October morning, and through
streets already white with the incipient frost of approaching
winter, to see a fellow-creature&mdash;and that
a woman&mdash;thus hurried out of existence. On arriving
at the gloomy prison-house I saw a fringe of roughs
lounging about, anxious to catch a glimpse, if only
of the black flag that should apprize them of the
tragedy they were no longer privileged to witness.
Even these, however, did not muster in strong force
until the hour of execution drew near. On knocking
at the outer wicket, the orders of admission were
severely scrutinized, and none allowed to pass except
those borne by the representatives of the press, or
persons in some way officially connected with the
impending "event." There was an air of grim
"business" about all present, which showed plainly
that none were there from choice, nor any who would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
not feel relief when the fearful spectacle was over.
After assembling, first of all, in the porter's lodge,
we were conducted by the governor, Mr. Keene, to
the back of the prison, through courtyards and
kitchen gardens; and in a corner of one of the former
we came upon the ghastly instrument of death itself.
Here half-a-dozen warders only were scattered about,
and Mr. Calcraft was arranging his paraphernalia with
the air of a connoisseur. I remember&mdash;so strangely
does one's mind take in unimportant details at such
a crisis&mdash;being greatly struck with the fine leeks
which were growing in that particular corner of the
prison garden where the grim apparatus stood, and
we&mdash;some five-and-twenty at most, and all in the
way of "business"&mdash;stood, too, waiting for the event!</p>

<p>Then ensued a quarter of an hour's pause, in that
cold morning air, when suddenly boomed out the
prison bell, that told us the last few minutes of the
convict's life had come. The pinioning took place
within the building; and on the stroke of nine, the
gloomy procession emerged, the prisoner walking
between the chaplain and Calcraft, with a firm step,
and even mounting the steep stair to the gallows
without needing assistance. She was attired in a
plaid dress with silk mantle, her head bare, and hair
neatly arranged.</p>

<p>As this was my first experience in private hanging,
I do not mind confessing that I misdoubted my
powers of endurance. I put a small brandy-flask in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
my pocket, and stood close by a corner around which
I could retire if the sight nauseated me; but such is
the strange fascination attaching to exhibitions even
of this horrible kind, that I pushed forward with the
rest, and when the governor beckoned me on to a
"good place," I found myself standing in the front
rank with the rest of my confr&egrave;res, and could not
help picturing what that row of upturned, unsympathizing,
pitiless faces must have looked like to the
culprit as contrasted with the more sympathetic
crowds that used to be present at a public execution.</p>

<p>One of the daily papers in chronicling this event
went so far as to point a moral on the brutalizing
effect of such exhibitions from my momentary hesitation
and subsequent struggle forward into the front
rank. The convict's perfect sang froid had a good
deal to do with my own calmness, I expect.</p>

<p>When the executioner had placed the rope round
her neck, and the cap on her head ready to be drawn
over the face, she uttered a long and fervent prayer,
expressed with great volubility and propriety of
diction, every word of which could be distinctly heard
by us as we circled the scaffold. She could not have
rounded her periods more gracefully or articulated
them more perfectly, if she had rehearsed her part
beforehand! Though most of the spectators were
more or less inured to scenes of horror, several were
visibly affected, one kneeling on the bare ground, and
another leaning, overcome with emotion, against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
prison wall. At last she said to the chaplain, "Mr.
Jessopp, do you think I am saved?" A whispered
reply from the clergyman conveyed his answer to that
momentous question. All left the scaffold except the
convict. The bolt was withdrawn, and, almost without
a struggle, Margaret Waters ceased to exist. Nothing
could exceed the calmness and propriety of her demeanour,
and this, the chaplain informed us, had
been the case throughout since her condemnation.
She had been visited on one occasion by a Baptist
minister, to whose persuasion she belonged; but he
had, at her own request, forborne to repeat his visit.
The prisoner said he was evidently unused to cases
like hers, and his ministrations rather distracted than
comforted her. The chaplain of the gaol had been
unremitting in his attentions, and seemingly with
happy effect. Though she constantly persisted in
saying she was not a murderess in intent, she was yet
brought to see her past conduct in its true light; and
on the previous Saturday received the Holy Communion
in her cell with one of her brothers. Two of
them visited her, and expressed the strongest feelings
of attachment. In fact, the unhappy woman seemed
to have been deeply attached to and beloved by all
the members of her family. She had, since her condemnation,
eaten scarcely anything, having been kept
alive principally by stimulants. Although this, of
course, induced great bodily weakness, she did not
from the first exhibit any physical fear of death. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the night before her execution&mdash;that peaceful moonlit
night&mdash;when so many thoughts must have turned to
this unhappy woman, she slept little, and rose early.
The chaplain had arranged to be with her at eight, but
she sent for him an hour earlier, and he continued
with her until the end. On Monday night she
penned a long statement addressed to Mr. Jessopp.
This was written with a firm hand on four sides of a
foolscap sheet, expressed with great perspicuity, and
signed with the convict's name. Whilst still repudiating
the idea of being a murderess in intent, she
pleaded guilty to great deceit, and to having obtained
money under false pretences. If she had not given
proper food, that, she contended, was an error of
judgment. It was hard, she thought, that she should
be held accountable for the child who died in the
workhouse. She dwelt much upon the difficulties
brought upon her by her dread of the money-lender&mdash;that
fungus growth of our so-called civilization, who
has brought so many criminals to the gallows, besides
ruining families every day in each year of grace!
That she had administered laudanum she denied.
The evidence as to the dirty condition of the children
she asserted to be false. She wished to avoid all
bitterness; but those who had so deposed had sworn
falsely. "I feel sure their consciences will condemn
them to-night," she wrote, "for having caused the
death of a fellow-creature." In the face of the evidence,
she felt the jury could not find any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
verdict, or the judge pass any other sentence than
had been done. The case had been got up, she
argued, to expose a system which was wrong.
Parents wished to get rid of their ill-gotten offspring.
Their one thought was to hide their own shame.
"They," she concluded, "are the real sinners. If it
were not for their sin, <i>we</i> should not be sought after."</p>

<p>There must surely be some whose consciences these
words will prick. However this woman deserved the
bitter penalty she has now paid, there is indeed a
tremendous truth in her assertion that she, and such
as she, are but the supply which answers their
demand.</p>

<p>And so we filed away as the autumnal sun shone
down upon that gloomy spectacle, leaving her to the
"crowner's 'quest," and the dishonoured grave in the
prison precincts. Up to the previous night strong hopes
of a commutation of the sentence were entertained.
Her brothers had memorialized the Home Secretary,
and were only on the previous day informed that the
law must take its course. Let us hope that this
stern example will put a stop, not only to "baby-farming,"
which, as the dead woman truly said, is
but a consequence of previous crime&mdash;but also to
those "pleasant vices" which are its antecedents and
encouragements.</p>

<h3>BREAKING UP FOR THE HOLIDAYS.</h3>


<p>Unromantic as it sounds to say it, I know of few
things more disgusting than to revisit one's old school
after some twenty or thirty years. Let that dubious
decade still remain as to the number of years that
have elapsed since I left school. In fact, it matters
to nobody when I left it; I revisited it lately. I
went to see the boys break up, as I once broke up,
and I felt disgusted&mdash;not with the school, or the
breaking up, but with myself. I felt disgracefully old.
In fact, I went home, and began a poem with these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My years, I feel, are getting on:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, ere the trembling balance kicks, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will imitate the dying swan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sing an ode threnodic&mdash;vixi.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I never got any farther than that. By the way, I
shall have to mention eventually that the school was
King's College, in the Strand. I am not going to
unbosom beyond this, or to add anything in the way
of an autobiography; but the locale would have to
come out anon, and there is no possible reason for concealment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I went to see them break up for the holidays,
and only got over my antediluvian feelings by seeing
one of the masters still on the staff who was there
when I was a boy. It was a comfort to think what a
Methuselah he must be; and yet, if he will excuse the
personality, he looked as rosy and smooth-faced as
when he used to stand me outside his door with my
coat-sleeves turned inside out. It was a way he had.
Well, the presence of that particular master made me
feel an Adonis forthwith.</p>

<p>I will not go into the prizes. There were lots of
them, and they were very nice, and the boys looked
very happy, and their mammas legitimately proud.
What I want to speak of is the school speeches or recitations,
as they are termed. King's College School
speeches are, to my thinking, a model of what such
things ought to be.</p>

<p>Some schools&mdash;I name no names&mdash;go in for mere
scholastic recitations which nobody understands, and
the boys hate. Others burst out in full-blown theatricals.
King's College acts on the motto, Medio
tutissimus ibis. It keeps the old scholastic recitations,
but gilds the pill by adding the accessory of costume.
I can quote Latin as well as Dr. Pangloss, and certain
lines were running in my mind all the time I was in
King's College Hall. They were</p>

<p>
Pueris olim dant crustula blandi<br />
Doctores, elementa velint ut discere prima.<br />
</p>

<p>First we had a bit of German in the shape of an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>tract
from Kotzebue's "Die Schlaue Wittwe," or
"Temperaments." I wish I had my programme, I
would compliment by name the lad who played the
charming young Frau. Suffice it to say the whole
thing went off sparkling like a firework. It was short,
and made you wish for more&mdash;a great virtue in
speeches and sermons. The dancing-master was
perfect. Then came a bit of Colman's "Heir at
Law." Dr. Pangloss&mdash;again I regret the absence of
the programme&mdash;was a creation, and&mdash;notwithstanding
the proximity of King's College to the Strand
Theatre&mdash;the youth wisely abstained from copying
even so excellent a model as Mr. Clarke. Of course,
the bits of Latinity came out with a genuine scholastic
ring. Then a bit of a Greek play, at which&mdash;mirabile
dictu!&mdash;everybody laughed, and with which
everybody was pleased. And why? Because the
adjuncts of costume and properties added to the
correct enunciation of the text, prevented even those,
who knew little Latin and less Greek, from being one
moment in the dark as to what was going on. The
passage was one from the "Birds" of Aristophanes;
and the fact of a treaty being concluded between the
Olympians and terrestrials, led to the introduction of
some interpolations as to the Washington Treaty,
which, when interpreted by the production of the
American flag and English Union Jack, brought down
thunders of applause. The final chorus was sung to
"Yankee Doodle," and accompanied by a fiddle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
The acting and accessories were perfect; and what
poor Robson used to term the "horgan" of Triballos,
was wonderful. That youth would be a nice young
man for a small tea party. It is to be hoped that,
like Bottom the weaver, he can modulate his voice,
and roar as gently as any sucking-dove.</p>

<p>Most wonderful, however, of all the marvels&mdash;that
met me at my old school&mdash;was a scene from the
"Critic," played by the most Lilliputian boys. Puff&mdash;played
by Powell (I don't forget that name)&mdash;was simply
marvellous. And yet Powell, if he will forgive me for
saying so, was the merest whipper-snapper. Sir Christopher
Hatton could scarcely have emerged from the
nursery; and yet the idea of utter stolidity never found
a better exponent than that same hom&oelig;opathic boy.</p>

<p>Last of all came the conventional scene from
Moli&egrave;re's "L'Avare." Ma&icirc;tre Jacques was good;
Harpagon more than good. I came away well satisfied,
only regretting I had not brought my eldest
boy to see it. My eldest boy! Egad, and I was just
such as he is now, when I used to creep like a snail
unwillingly to those scholastic shades. The spirit of
Pangloss came upon me again as I thought of all
I had seen that day,&mdash;there was nothing like it in
my day. King's College keeps pace with the times.
"Tempora mutantur!" I mentally exclaimed; and
added, not without a pleasant scepticism, as I gazed
once more on the pippin-faced master, "I wonder
whether&mdash;nos mutamur in illis?"</p>

<h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL LADIES.</h3>


<p>There is no doubt that the "Woman's Rights"
question is going ahead with gigantic strides, not
only in social and political, but also in intellectual
matters. Boys and girls&mdash;or rather we ought to say
young ladies and young gentlemen&mdash;are grouped together
on the class list of the Oxford Local Examination,
irrespective of sex. A glance at the daily
papers will show us that women are being lectured to
on all subjects down from physical sciences, through
English literature and art, to the construction of the
clavecin. We had fancied, however, that what are
technically termed "the Humanities," or, in University
diction, "Science"&mdash;meaning thereby ethics
and logic&mdash;were still our own. Now, we are undeceived.
We are reminded that woman can say, without
a solecism, "Homo sum," and may therefore
claim to embrace even the humanities among her
subjects of study. Henceforth the realm of woman is
not merely what may be called "pianofortecultural,"
as was once the case. It has soared even above art,
literature, and science itself into what might at first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sight appear the uncongenial spheres of dialectics and
metaphysics.</p>

<p>Professor G. Croom Robertson recently commenced
a course of thirty lectures to ladies on Psychology
and Logic, at the Hall, 15, Lower Seymour Street,
Portman Square. Urged, it may be, rather by a
desire to see whether ladies would be attracted by
such a subject, and, if so, what psychological ladies
were like, than by any direct interest in the matters
themselves, I applied to the hon. secretary, inquiring
whether the inferior sex were admissible; and was
answered by a ticket admitting one's single male self
and a party of ladies &agrave; discr&eacute;tion. The very entrance
to the hall&mdash;nay, the populous street itself&mdash;removed
my doubts as to whether ladies would be attracted by
the subjects; and on entering I discovered that the
audience consisted of several hundred ladies, and two
unfortunate&mdash;or shall it not rather be said privileged?&mdash;members
of the male sex. The ladies were
of all ages, evidently matrons as well as spinsters,
with really nothing at all approaching a "blue stocking"
element; but all evidently bent on business.
All were taking vigorous notes, and seemed to follow
the Professor's somewhat difficult Scotch diction at
least as well as our two selves, who appeared to
represent not only the male sex in general, but the
London press in particular.</p>

<p>Professor Robertson commenced by a brief and
well-timed reference to the accomplished Hypatia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
familiar to ladies from Kingsley's novel&mdash;in the days
when ladies used to read novels&mdash;and also the Royal
ladies whom Descartes and Leibnitz found apter
disciples than the savants. It was, however, he remarked,
an impertinence to suppose that any apology
was needed for introducing such subjects before ladies.
He plunged therefore at once in medias res, and
made his first lecture not a mere isolated or introductory
one, but the actual commencement of his
series. Unreasoned facts, he said, formed but a mere
fraction of our knowledge&mdash;even the simplest processes
resolving themselves into a chain of inference.
Truth is the result of logical reasoning; and not
only truth, but truth <i>for all</i>. The sciences deal with
special aspects of truth. These sciences may be
arranged in the order&mdash;1. Mathematics; 2. Physics;
3. Chemistry; 4. Biology&mdash;each gradually narrowing
its sphere; the one enclosed, so to say, in the other,
and each presupposing those above it. Logic was presupposed
in all. Each might be expressed by a word
ending in "logy," therefore logic might be termed
the "science of sciences." The sciences were special
applications of logic. Scientific men speak lightly of
logic, and say truth can be discovered without it.
This is true, but trivial. We may as well object to
physiology because we can digest without a knowledge
of it; or to arithmetic, because it is possible
to reckon without it. Scientific progress has been
great; but its course might have been strewn with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fewer wrecks had its professors been more generally
logicians. But then logic presupposes something
else. We have to investigate the origin and growth
of knowledge&mdash;the laws under which knowledge comes
to be. Under one aspect this science&mdash;psychology&mdash;should
be placed highest up in the scale; but under
another it would rank later in point of development
than even biology itself, because it is not every being
that thinks. This twofold aspect is accounted for
by the peculiarity of its subject-matter&mdash;viz., mind.</p>

<p>The sciences are comparatively modern. Mathematics
but some 3000 or 4000 years old; physics,
three centuries; chemistry, a thing of the last, biology
only of the present century. But men philosophized
before the sciences. The ancient Greeks had but one
science&mdash;mathematics. Now men know a little of
many sciences; but what we want is men to connect&mdash;to
knit together&mdash;the sciences; to have their knowledge
all of a piece. The knowledge of the ancient
Greek directed his actions, and entered far more into
his daily life than ours does. This, he observed, was
philosophy. This is what we want now; and this
is what is to be got from psychology. There is not
a single thing between heaven and earth that does
not admit of a mental expression; or, in other words,
possess a subjective aspect, and therefore come under
psychology.</p>

<p>This, in briefest outline, is a sketch of the "strong
meat" offered to the psychological ladies. A single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
branch of psychology&mdash;that, namely, of the intellect,
excluding that of feeling and action&mdash;is to occupy ten
lectures, the above being number one. The other
twenty will be devoted to logic.</p>

<p>The next lecture was devoted to an examination of
the brain and nervous system, and their office in
mental processes. Alas, however, how different was
now the audience! Only some thirty ladies&mdash;scarcely
more than one-tenth of those who were present at
the opening lecture&mdash;have permanently entered for
the course. It is no disrespect to the ladies to hazard
the conjecture whether the subject be not a little
out of range for the present. We are moving ahead
rapidly, and many foolish ideas as to the intellectual
differences of the sexes are becoming obsolete. We
have literary and artistic ladies by thousands. Scientific
ladies, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
are coming well to the front. Possibly we may have
to "wait a little longer" before we get, on anything
like a large scale, psychological or even logical ladies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>SECULARISM ON BUNYAN.</h3>


<p>It is very marvellous to observe the number of strange
and unexpected combinations that are continually occurring
in that moral kaleidoscope we call society. I
do not suppose that I am exceptional in coming
across these; nor do I use any particular industry in
seeking them out. They come to me; all I do is to
keep my eyes open, and note the impressions they
make on me. I was humbly pursuing my way one
Tuesday evening towards the abode of a phrenologist
with the honest intention of discovering my craniological
condition, when, in passing down Castle Street,
Oxford Market, I was made aware that Mr. G. J.
Holyoake was there and then to deliver himself on
the "Literary Genius of Bunyan." This was one of
the incongruous combinations I spoke of; and forthwith
I passed into the Co-operative Hall, resolving to
defer my visit to the phrenologist. There are some
facts of which it is better to remain contentedly
ignorant; and I have no doubt my own mental condition
belongs to that category.</p>

<p>I found the Co-operative Hall a handsome and commodious
building; and a very fair audience had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
gathered to listen to Mr. Holyoake, who is an elderly
thin-voiced man, and his delivery was much impeded
on the occasion in question by the circumstance of his
having a bad cold and cough. After a brief extempore
allusion to the fact of the Duke of Bedford
having erected a statue to Bunyan, which he regarded
as a sort of compensation for his Grace ceasing to
subscribe to the races, Mr. Holyoake proceeded to read
his treatise, which he had written on several slips of
paper&mdash;apparently backs of circulars&mdash;and laid one by
one on a chair as he finished them.</p>

<p>The world, he said, is a big place; but people are
always forgetting what a variety of humanity it contains.
Two hundred years ago, the authorities of
Bedford made it very unpleasant for one John Bunyan,
because they thought they knew everything, and
could not imagine that a common street workman
might know more. The trade of a tinker seems an
unpromising preparation for a literary career. A
tinker in Bedford to-day would not find himself much
flattered by the attentions paid him, especially if he
happened to be an old gaol-bird as well. So much the
more creditable to Bunyan the ascendancy he gained.
If he mended pots as well as he made sentences he was
the best tinker that ever travelled.</p>

<p>Bunyan had no worldly notions. His doctrine was
that men were not saved by any good they might do&mdash;a
doctrine that would ruin the morals of any commercial
establishment in a month! He declared him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>self
the "chief of sinners;" but judged by his townsmen
he was a stout-hearted, stout-minded, scrupulous
man.</p>

<p>He was not a pleasant man to know. He had an
unrelenting sincerity which often turned into severity.
Yet he had much tenderness. He had a soul like a
Red Indian's&mdash;all tomahawk and truth, until the
literary passion came and added humour to it. He
demands in his vigorous doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">May I not write in such a style as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a method, too, and yet not miss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My end, thy good? Why may it not be done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark clouds bring waters, when the bright bring none.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Like all men of original genius, this stout-minded
pot-mender had unbounded confidence in himself. He
was under no delusion as to his own powers. No man
knew better what he was about. He could take the
measure of all the justices about him, and he knew it.
Every shallow-headed gentleman in Bedfordshire
towns and villages was made to wince under his picturesque
and satiric tongue. To clergymen, bishops,
lawyers, and judges he gave names which all his
neighbours knew. Mr. Pitiless, Mr. Hardheart, Mr.
Forget-good, Mr. No-truth, Mr. Haughty&mdash;thus he
named the disagreeable dignitaries of the town of
Mansoul.</p>

<p>At first he was regarded by his "pastors and
masters" as a mere wilful, noisy, praying sectary.
Very soon they discovered that he was a fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
preacher. As tinker or Christian he always had his
sleeves turned up. When he had to try his own
cause he put in the jury-box Mr. True-Heart, Mr.
Upright, Mr. Hate-Bad, Mr. See-Truth, and other
amiable persons. His witnesses were Mr. Know-All,
Mr. Tell-True, Mr. Hate-Lies, Mr. Vouch-Truth, Mr.
Did-See. His Town Clerk was Mr. Do-Right, the
Recorder was Mr. Conscience, the gaoler was Mr.
True-Man, Lord Understanding was on the bench,
and the Judge bears the dainty name of the "Golden-headed
Prince."</p>

<p>Bunyan's adversaries are always a bad set. They
live in Villain's Lane, in Blackmouth Street, or
Blasphemer's Row, or Drunkard's Alley, or Rascal's
Corner. They are the sons of one Beastly, whose
mother bore them in Flesh Square: they live at the
house of one Shameless, at the sign of the Reprobate,
next door to the Descent into the Pit, whose retainers
are Mr. Flatter, Mr. Impiety, Mr. False-Peace, Mr.
Covetousness, who are housed by one Mr. Simple, in
Folly's Yard.</p>

<p>Bunyan had a perfect wealth of sectarian scurrility
at his command. His epithets are at times unquotable
and ferocious. When, however, his friends are
at the bar, the witnesses against them comprise the
choicest scoundrels of all time&mdash;Mr. Envy, Mr. Pick-thank,
and others, whose friends are Lord Carnal-Delight,
Lord Luxurious, Lord Lechery, Sir Having
Greedy, and similar villanous people of quality. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Judge's name is now Lord Hate-Good. The Jury
consist of Mr. No-Good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-Lust,
Mr. Live-Loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. Hate-Light, Mr.
Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, and Mr. Implacable,
with Mr. Blindman for Foreman.</p>

<p>Never was such an infamous gang impanelled.
Rancour and rage and vindictiveness, and every
passion awakened in the breasts of the strong by
local insolence and legal injustice, is supplied by
Bunyan with epithets of immense retaliative force.
He is the greatest name-maker among authors. He
was a spiritual Comanche. He prayed like a savage.
He said himself, when describing the art of the religious
rhetorician&mdash;an art of which he was the
greatest master of his time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You see the ways the fisherman doth take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the fish; what engines doth he make!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! how he engageth all his wits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Also his snares, lines, angles, hooks, and nets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fish there be that neither hook nor line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor snare, nor net, nor engine can make thine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They must be grop'd for, and be tickled too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or they will not be catch'd, whate'er you do.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bunyan never tickled the sinner. It was not his
way. He carried a prong. He pricked the erring.
He published a pamphlet to suggest what ought to be
done to holy pedestrians, whose difficulties lay rearward.
He put detonating balls under their feet which
exploded as they stepped and alarmed them along.
He lined the celestial road with horrors. If they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
turned their heads they saw a fiend worse than Lot's
wife who was merely changed into a pillar of sweet
all-preserving salt. Bunyan's unfortunate converts
who looked back fell into a pit filled with fire, where
they howled and burnt for evermore.</p>

<p>Ah! with what pleasure must the great Bedfordshire
artist have contemplated his masterly pages as
day by day he added to them the portrait of some
new scoundrel, or painted with dexterous and loving
hand the wholesome outlines of some honest man, or
devised some new phrase which like a new note or
new colour would delight singer or painter for generations
yet to come. He must have strode proudly
along his cell as he put his praise and his scorn into
imperishable similes.</p>

<p>But Bunyan had never been great had he been
merely disagreeable. He had infinite wit in him. It
was his carnal genius that saved him. He wrote sixty
books, and two of them&mdash;the "Siege of the Town of
Mansoul" and the "Pilgrim's Progress"&mdash;exceed all
ever written for creative swiftness of imagination,
racy English speech, sentences of literary art, cunningness
in dialogue, satire, ridicule, and surpassing knowledge
of the picturesque ways of the obscure minds of
common men. In his pages men rise out of the
ground&mdash;they always come up on an open space so
that they can be seen. They talk naturally, so that
you know them at once; and they act without delay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
so that you never forget them. They surprise you,
delight you, they interest you, they instruct you, and
disappear. They never linger, they never weary you.
Incidents new and strange arise at every step in his
story. The scene changes like the men and their adventures.
Now it is field or morass, plain or bypath,
bog or volcano, castle or cottage, sandy scorching
desert or cold river; the smoke of the bottomless pit
or bright, verdant, delectable mountains and enchanted
lands where there are no bishops, no gaols, and no
tinkers; where aboundeth grapes, calico, brides, eternal
conversation, and trumpets. The great magician's
genius forsakes him when he comes to the unknown
regions, and he knoweth no more than the rest of us.
But while his foot is on the earth he steps like a king
among writers. His Christian is no fool. He is
cunning of fence, suspicious, sagacious, witty, satirical,
abounding in invective, and broad, bold, delicious insolence.
Bye-Ends is a subtle, evasive knave drawn
with infinite skill.</p>

<p>Had Bunyan merely preached the Gospel he had
no more been remembered than thousands of his day
who are gratefully forgotten&mdash;had he prayed to this
time he had won no statue; but his literary genius
lives when the preacher is very dead.</p>

<p>He saw with such vividness that the very passions
and wayward moods of men stood apart and distinct
in his sight, and he gave names to them and endowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
them with their natural speech. He created new men
out of characteristics of mind, and sent them into the
world in shapes so defined and palpable that men
know them for evermore. It was the way of his age
for writers to give names to their adversaries. Bunyan
imitated this in his life of Mr. Badman. Others did
this, but Bunyan did it better than any man. His
invention was marvellous, and he had besides the
faculty of the dramatist.</p>

<p>If any man wrote the adventures of a Co-operator,
he would have to tell of his meeting with Mr. Obstinate,
who will not listen to him, and wants to pull him
back. We all get the company of Mr. Pliable, who is
persuaded without being convinced, who at the first
splash into difficulty crawls out and turns back with
a cowardly adroitness. We have all encountered the
stupidity of Mr. Ignorance, which nothing can
enlighten. We know Mr. Turnaway, who comes
from the town of Apostacy, whose face we cannot
perfectly see. Others merely gave names, he drew
characters, he made the qualities of his men speak;
you knew them by their minds better than by their
dress. That is why succeeding ages have read the
"Pilgrim's Progress," because the same people who
met that extraordinary traveller are always turning
up in the way of every man who has a separate and a
high purpose, and is bent upon carrying it out.
Manners change, but humanity has still its old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ways. It is because Bunyan painted these that his
writing lasts like a picture by one of the old masters
who painted for all time.</p>

<p>Such is an outline of the paper, which was interesting
from its associations, and only spoilt by the
cough. We had had Bunyan in pretty well every
shape possible during the last few weeks. Certainly
one of the most original is this which presents the
man of unbounded faith in the light of utter
scepticism.</p>

<h3>AL FRESCO INFIDELITY.</h3>


<p>In a series of papers like the present it is necessary,
every now and then, to pause and apologize, either for
the nature of the work in general, or for certain particulars
in its execution calculated to shock good
people whose feelings one would wish to respect.
Having so long been engaged in the study of infidelity
in London, I may, perhaps, be permitted to speak with
something like authority in the matter; and I have
no hesitation in saying that I believe the policy of
shirking the subject is the most fatal and foolish one
that could be adopted. Not only does such a course
inspire people, especially young people, with the idea
that there is something very fascinating in infidelity&mdash;something
which, if allowed to meet their gaze,
would be sure to attract and convince them&mdash;than
which nothing is farther from the truth&mdash;not only so,
however, but many of the statements and most of the
arguments which sound plausibly enough on the glib
tongue of a popular speaker read very differently indeed,
when put down in cold-blooded letter-press,
and published in the pages of a book. I protest
strongly against making a mystery of London infi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>delity.
It has spread and is spreading, I know, and
it is well the public should know; but I believe
there would be no such antidote to it as for people to
be fully made aware how and where it is spreading.
That is the r&ocirc;le I have all along proposed to myself:
not to declaim against any man or any system, not to
depreciate or disguise the truth, but simply to
describe. I cannot imagine a more legitimate method
of doing my work.</p>

<p>I suppose no one will regard it in any way as an indulgence
or a luxury on the part of a clergyman, who
be it remembered, is, during a portion of the Sunday,
engaged in ministering to Christian people, that he
should devote another portion of that day to hearing
Christ vilified, and having his own creed torn to
pieces. I myself feel that my own belief is not
shaken, but in a tenfold degree confirmed by all I
have heard and seen and written of infidelity; and
therefore I cannot concede the principle that to convey
my experiences to others is in any way dangerous.
Take away the halo of mystery that surrounds this
subject, and it would possess very slender attractions
indeed.</p>

<p>It was, for instance, on what has always appeared
to me among the most affecting epochs of our
Christian year, the Fifth Sunday after Easter&mdash;Christ's
last Sunday upon earth&mdash;that, by one of those violent
antitheses, I went to Gibraltar Walk, Bethnal Green
Road, to hear Mr. Ramsey there demolish the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
system which, for many years, it has been my mission
to preach. I did not find, and I hope my congregation
did not find, that I faltered in my message
that evening. I even venture to think that Mr.
Ramsey's statements, which I shall repeat as faithfully
as possible, will scarcely seem as convincing here
as they did when he poured them forth so fluently to
the costermongers and navvies of the Bethnal Green
Road; and if this be true of Mr. Ramsey it is certainly
so of the smaller men; for he is a master in his
craft, and certainly a creditable antagonist for a
Christian to meet with the mild defensive weapons we
have elected to use.</p>

<p>When the weather proves fine, as it ought to have
done in May, 1874, infidelity adjourns from its generally
slummy halls to the street corners, and to fields
which are often the reverse of green; thus adopting,
let me remark in passing, one of the oldest instrumentalities
of Christianity itself, one, too, in which
we shall do well to follow its example. Fas est ab
hoste doceri&mdash;I cannot repeat too often. Scorning
the attractions of the railway arches in the St.
Pancras Road, where I hope soon to be a listener, I
sped vi&acirc; the Metropolitan Railway and tram to Shoreditch
Church, not far from which, past the Columbia
Market and palatial Model Lodging Houses, is the
unpicturesque corner called Gibraltar Walk, debouching
from the main road, with a triangular scrap of
very scrubby ground, flanked by a low wall, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
young Bethnal Green is rapidly erasing from the face
of the earth. When I got here, I found an unclerical-looking
gentleman in a blue great-coat and sandy
moustache erecting his rostrum in the shape of a small
deal stool, from whence I could see he was preparing
to pour forth the floods of his rhetoric by diligent
study of some exceedingly greasy notes which he held
in his hand and perused at what I feel sure must
have been the windiest street corner procurable outside
the cave of &AElig;olus. I fell back into the small but
very far from select crowd which had already begun
to gather, and an old man, who was unmistakably a
cobbler, having ascertained that I had come to hear
the lecture, told me he had "listened to a good many
of 'em, but did not feel much for'arder." Undismayed
by this intelligence I still elected to tarry, despite the
cruel nor'-easter that was whistling round the corner
of the Bethnal Green Road. In a few minutes I
perceived a slight excitement in the small gathering
due to the fact that the Christians had put in an appearance,
so that there would be some opposition.
Mr. Harrington, a young man whom I had heard once
speak fluently enough on the theistic side at an infidel
meeting, was unpacking his rostrum, which was
a patent folding one, made of deal, like that of his
adversary, but neatly folded along with a large Bible,
inside a green baize case. Both gentlemen commenced
proceedings at the same time; and as they
had pitched their stools very close to one another, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
result was very much like that of two grinding organs
in the same street. Of the two, Mr. Harrington's voice
was louder than Mr. Ramsey's. The latter gentleman
had a sore throat, and had to be kept lubricated by
means of a jug of water, which a brother heretic held
ready at his elbow. Mr. Harrington was in prime condition,
but his congregation was smaller than ours;
for I kept at first&mdash;I was going to say religiously, I
suppose I ought to say <i>ir</i>-religiously&mdash;to the infidels.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsey, who had a rooted aversion to the
letter "h," except where a smooth breathing is usual,
began by saying that Christianity differed from other
religions in the fact of its having an eternal 'Ell.
The Mahometans had their beautiful ladies; the
North American Indian looked for his 'Appy 'Unting
Grounds; but 'Ell was a speciality of the Christian
system. On the other side was the fact that you
continually had salvation inundated upon you. Tracts
were put into your hand, asking&mdash;"What must I do
to be saved?" We had to pay for this salvation about
11,000,000<i>l.</i> a year to the Church of England, and
something like an equal amount to the Dissenters.
In fact every tub-thumper went about preaching and
ruining servant girls, and for this we paid over
twenty millions a year&mdash;more than the interest on the
whole National Debt. After this elegant exordium, Mr.
Ramsey said he proposed to divide his remarks under
four heads. 1. Is Salvation necessary? 2. What are
we to be saved from? 3. What for? 4. How?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>1. According to the Christian theory, God, after an
eternity of "doin' nothin'," created the world. He
made Adam sin by making sin for him to commit;
and then damned him for doing what He knew he
would do. He predestined you&mdash;the audience&mdash;to be
damned because of Adam's sin; but after a time God
"got sick and tired of damning people," and sent His
Son to redeem mankind.</p>

<p>This flower of rhetoric tickled Bethnal Green immensely;
but Mr. Harrington was equal to the
occasion, and thundered out his orthodoxy so successfully
that Mr. Ramsey took a longer drink than usual,
and complained that he was not having "a free platform"&mdash;it
was so he dignified the rickety stool on
which he was perched. He then meandered into a
long dissection of Genesis i., appearing to feel particularly
aggrieved by the fact of the moon being said to
"rule the night," though I could not see how this
was relevant to the Christian scheme of salvation;
and a superb policeman, who had listened for a
moment to Mr. Ramsey's astronomical lucubrations,
evidently shared my feelings and passed on superciliously.
I devoutly wished my duty had permitted
me to do the same.</p>

<p>The speaker then went into a long dissertation on
the primal sin; the gist of which was that though
the woman had never been warned not to eat of the
Forbidden Fruit, she had to bear the brunt of the
punishment. Then&mdash;though one is almost ashamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to chronicle such a triviality&mdash;he waxed very wroth
because the serpent was spoken of as being cursed
above all "cattle." Who ever heard of snakes being
called cattle? He was condemned to go on his belly.
How did he go before? Did he go on his back or
"'op" along on the tip of his tail? These pleasantries
drew all Mr. Harrington's audience away except
a few little dirty boys on the wall. Mr. Ramsey
clearly knew his audience, and "acted to the gallery."</p>

<p>2. But what were we to be saved from? Eternal
'Ell-fire. This 'Ell-fire was favourite sauce for sermons,
and served to keep people awake. Where was
'Ell? It was said to be a bottomless pit; if so, he
should be all right, because he could get out at the
other end! Then, again, 'Ell was said to be a very
'ot place. When the missionaries told the Greenlanders
that, everybody wanted to go to 'Ell; so they
had to change their tune and say it was very cold.
Mr. Ramsey omitted to mention his authority for this
statement.</p>

<p>Into his pleasantries on the monotony of life in
'Eaven, I do not feel inclined to follow this gentleman.
The Atonement, he went on to remark, if
necessary at all, came 4000 years too late. It should
have been&mdash;so we were to believe on his ipse dixit&mdash;contemporaneous
with the Fall. This atonement we
were to avail ourselves of by means of faith. Idiots
could not have faith, but were allowed to be saved.
Consequently, argued Mr. Ramsey, in conclusion, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
best thing for all of us would have been to have been
born idiots, and, consistently enough, Christianity
tried to turn us all into idiots.</p>

<p>Such were some of the statements. I refrain from
quoting the most offensive, which were deliberately
put forward at this al fresco infidels' meeting; and
with what result? Though a vast population kept
moving to and fro along that great highway there
were never, I am sure, more than a hundred people
gathered at the shrine of Mr. Ramsey. They laughed
at his profanities, yes; but directly he dropped these,
and grew argumentative, they talked, and had to be
vigorously reduced to order. Gallio-like they cared
for none of these things, and I am quite sure a good
staff of working clergy, men like Mr. Body or Mr.
Steele of St. Thomas's, who could talk to the people,
would annihilate Mr. Ramsey's prestige. As for Mr.
Harrington, he meant well, and had splendid lung-power,
but his theology was too sectarian to suit a
mixed body of listeners embracing all shades of
thought and no-thought.</p>

<p>Supposing Mr. Ramsey to have put forth all his
power that morning&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt
that he did so&mdash;I deliberately say that I should not
hesitate to take my own boy down to hear him,
because I feel that even his immature mind would be
able to realize how little there was to be said against
Christianity, if that were all.</p>

<h3>AN "INDESCRIBABLE PHENOMENON."</h3>


<p>When the bulk of the London Press elects to gush
over anything or anybody, there are at all events,
prim&acirc; facie grounds for believing that there is something
to justify such a consensus. When, moreover,
the object of such gush is a young lady claiming to
be a spirit-medium, the unanimity is so unusual as
certainly to make the matter worth the most careful
inquiry, for hitherto the London Press has either
denounced spiritualism altogether, or gushed singly
over individual mediums, presumably according to
the several proclivities of the correspondents. Of
Miss Annie Eva Fay, however&mdash;is not the very name
fairy-like and fascinating?&mdash;I read in one usually
sober-minded journal that "there is something not of
this earth about the young lady's powers." Another
averred that she was "a spirit medium of remarkable
and extraordinary power." Others, more cautious,
described the "mystery" as "bewildering," the
"entertainment" as "extraordinary and incomprehensible,"
while yet another seemed to me to afford
an index to the cause of this gush by saying that
"Miss Fay is a pretty young lady of about twenty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with a delicate spirituelle face, and a profusion of
light hair, frizzled on the forehead."</p>

<p>I made a point of attending Miss Annie Eva Fay's
opening performance at the Hanover Square Rooms,
and found all true enough as to the pretty face and
the frizzled hair. Of the "indescribable" nature of
the "phenomenon" (for by that title is Miss Fay
announced, &agrave; la Vincent Crummles) there may be two
opinions, according as we regard the young lady as a
kind of Delphic Priestess and Cum&aelig;an Sibyl rolled
into one, or simply a clever conjuror&mdash;conjuress, if
there be such a word.</p>

<p>Let me, then, with that delightful inconsistency so
often brought to bear on the so-called or self-styled
"supernatural," first describe the "indescribable,"
and then, in the language of the unspiritual Dr.
Lynn, tell how it is all done; for, of course, I found it
all out, like a great many others of the enlightened
and select audience which gathered at Miss Annie
Eva Fay's first drawing-room reception in the Queen's
Concert Rooms.</p>

<p>Arriving at the door half an hour too early, as I
had misread the time of commencement, I found at
the portal Mr. Burns, of the Progressive Library, and
a gentleman with a diamond brooch in his shirt-front,
whom I guessed at once, from that adornment, to be
the proprietor of the indescribable phenomenon, and
I was, in fact, immediately introduced to him as
Colonel Fay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing in due course within the cavernous room
which might have suited well a Cum&aelig;an Sibyl on a
small scale, I found the platform occupied by a tiny
cabinet, unlike that of the Davenports in that
it was open in front, with a green curtain, which I
could see was destined to be let down during the
performance of the phenomenal manifestations. There
was a camp-stool inside the cabinet; a number of
cane-bottomed chairs on the platform, and also the
various properties of a spirit s&eacute;ance, familiar to me
from long experience, guitar, fiddle, handbells, tambourine,
&amp;c. One adjunct alone was new; and that
was a green stable bucket, destined, I could not
doubt, to figure in what my Rimmel-scented programme
promised as the climax of Part I.&mdash;the
"Great Pail Sensation." Presently Colonel Fay, in a
brief speech, nasal but fluent, introduced the subject,
and asked two gentlemen to act as a Committee of
Inspection. Two stepped forward immediately&mdash;indeed
too immediately, as the result proved; one a
"citizen of this city," as Colonel Fay had requested;
but the other a Hindoo young gentleman, who, I
believe, lost the confidence of the audience at once
from his foreign face and Oriental garb. However,
they were first to the front, and so were elected, and
proceeded at once to "examine" the cabinet in that
obviously helpless and imperfect way common to
novices who work with the gaze of an audience upon
them. Then, from a side door, stage left, enter the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Indescribable Phenomenon. A pretty young lady,
yes, and with light frizzled hair to any extent. There
was perhaps "a spirit look within her eyes;" but then
I have often found this to be the case with young
ladies of twenty. Her dress of light silk was beyond
reproach. I had seen Florence Cook and Miss
Showers lately; and,&mdash;well, I thought those two,
with the assistance of Miss Annie Eva Fay, would
have made a very pretty model for a statuette of the
Three Graces.</p>

<p>Miss Fay, after being described by the Colonel
vaguely enough as "of the United States," was bound
on both wrists with strips of calico; the knots were
sewn by the European gentleman&mdash;as distinguished
from the Asiatic youth. He was not quite au fait
at the needle, but got through it in time. Miss Fay
was then placed on the camp-stool, her wrists fastened
behind her, and her neck also secured to a ring screwed
into the back of the cabinet. A rope was tied round
her ankles, and passed right to the front of the stage,
where the Hindoo youth was located and bidden hold
it taut, which he did conscientiously, his attitude
being what Colman describes "like some fat gentleman
who bobbed for eels."</p>

<p>First of all, another strip of calico was placed loosely
round Miss Fay's neck; the curtain descended. Hey,
presto! it was up again, sooner than it takes to write,
and this strip was knotted doubly and trebly round
her neck. A tambourine hoop was put in her lap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and this, in like manner, was found encircling her
neck, as far as the effervescent hair would allow it.</p>

<p>The audience at this point grew a little fidgety;
and though they did not say anything against the
Oriental young gentleman, the 'cute American colonel
understood it, adding two others from the audience
to the committee on the stage, and leaving the young
gentleman to "bob" down below as if to keep him
out of mischief.</p>

<p>The other "manifestations" were really only different
in detail from the first. The guitar was placed
on the lap, the curtain fell and it played; so did the
fiddle&mdash;out of tune, as usual&mdash;and also a little glass
harmonicon with actually a soup&ccedil;on of melody. A
mouth-organ tootle-tooed, and what Colonel Fay described
as a "shingle nail" was driven with a hammer
into a piece of wood. A third of a tumbler of water
laid on the lap of the Indescribable Phenomenon was
drunk, and the great Pail Sensation consisted in the
bucket being put on her lap and then discovered slung
by the handle around her neck. The last "manifestation"
is the one to which I would draw attention;
for it was by this I discovered how it was all done.
A knife was put on Miss Fay's lap; the curtain
lowered, the knife pitched on to the platform, and
behold the Indescribable Phenomenon stepped from
the cabinet with the ligature that had bound her
wrists and neck severed.</p>

<p>Now, all through this portion of the entertainment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the audience, instead of sitting quiet, amused themselves
with proposing idiotic tests, or suggesting
audibly how it was all done. One man behind me
pertinaciously clung to the theory of a concealed boy,
and trotted him to the front after every phase of the
exhibition. He must have been infinitesimally small;
but that did not matter. It was "that boy again"
after every trick. One manifestation consisted in
putting a piece of paper and pair of scissors on Miss
Fay's lap, and having several "tender little infants"
cut out, as the Colonel phrased it.</p>

<p>Hereupon sprang up a 'cute individual in the room,
and produced a sheet of paper he had marked.
Would Miss Fay cut out a tender little infant from
that? Miss Fay consented, and of course did it, the
'cute individual retiring into private life for the rest
of the evening. Another wanted Miss Fay's mouth
to be bound with a handkerchief, and there was no
objection raised, until the common-sense and humanity
of the audience protested against such a needless
cruelty on a broiling night and in that Cum&aelig;an cave.
An excited gentleman in front of me, too, whose
mission I fancy was simply to protest against the
spiritual character of the phenomena (which was never
asserted) would interrupt us all from time to time by
declaring his intense satisfaction with it all. It was
a splendid trick. We tried to convince him that his
individual satisfaction was irrelevant to us, but it
was, as Wordsworth says, "Throwing words away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
It was a beautiful trick; and he was satisfied, quite
satisfied.</p>

<p>The Dark S&eacute;ance, which formed the second part of
the performance, was a dreadful mistake. It was not
only unsatisfactory in result, but&mdash;and no doubt this
was the reason&mdash;it was so mismanaged as to threaten
more than once to eventuate in a riot. Twelve or
fourteen persons were to form a committee representing
the audience, and to sit in a circle, with the
Indescribable Phenomenon in their centre, while we
remained below in Egyptian darkness and received
their report. Of course we all felt that we&mdash;if not
on the committee&mdash;might just as well be sitting at
home or in the next parish as in the cave of Cum&aelig;.
The method of electing the committee was briefly
stated by Colonel Fay to be "first come first served,"
and the consequence was a rush of some fifty excited
people on to the platform, with earnest requests on
the part of the proprietary to be "still." There was
no more stillness for the rest of the evening. The
fifty were pruned down to about fifteen of the most
pertinacious, who would not move at any price; in
fact, the others only descended on being promised
that the dark sitting should be divided into two,
and another committee appointed. The Indescribable
Phenomenon took her seat on the camp-stool in the
centre, where she was to remain clapping her hands,
to show she was not producing the manifestations.
The gas was put out and darkness prevailed&mdash;dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>ness,
but not silence. The disappointed and rejected
committee men&mdash;and women&mdash;first began to grumble
in the freedom which the darkness secured. The
committee was a packed one. They were Spiritualists.
This was vigorously denied by somebody, who said
he saw a Press man in the circle, and therefore (such
was his logic) he could not be a Spiritualist. All this
time the Indescribable Phenomenon was clapping her
hands, and now some of the more restless of the
audience clapped theirs in concert. The guitar and
fiddle began to thump and twang, and the bells to
ring, and then again the more refractory lunatics
amongst us began to beat accompaniment on our hats.
The whole affair was worthy of Bedlam or Hanwell,
or, let us add, an Indescribable Phenomenon.</p>

<p>The committee was changed with another rush, and
those who were finally exiled from the hope of sitting
took it out in the subsequent darkness by advising
us to "beware of our pockets." When Colonel Fay
asked for quietude he was rudely requested "not to
talk through his nose." It was not to be wondered
at that the s&eacute;ance was very brief, and the meeting
adjourned.</p>

<p>Now to describe the indescribable. If it be a spiritual
manifestation, of course there is an end of the
matter; but if a mere conjuring trick, I would call
attention to the following facts. The fastening of
Miss Fay's neck to the back of the cabinet at first is
utterly gratuitous. It offers no additional difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to any manifestations, and appears only intended to
prevent the scrutineers seeing behind her. A very
simple exercise of sleight of hand would enable the
gallant Colonel to cut the one ligature that binds the
two wrists, when, for instance, he goes into the
cabinet with scissors to trim off the ends of the piece
of calico in the opening trick. The hands being once
free all else is easy. The hands are <i>never once seen</i>
during the performance. The committee can feel
them, and feel the knots at the wrists; but they cannot
discover whether the ligature connecting the wrists
is entire.</p>

<p>The last trick, be it recollected, consists in the
ligature being cut and Miss Fay's coming free to the
front. If my theory is incorrect&mdash;and no doubt it
<i>is</i> ruinously wrong&mdash;will she consent to <i>omit the last
trick</i> and come to the front with wrists bound as she
entered the cabinet? Of course, if I had suggested
it, she would have done it as easily as she cut out the
tender infants for the 'cute gentleman behind me; so,
to adopt the language of Miss Fay's fellow-citizen, I
"bit in my breath and swallered it down." I adopted
the course Mr. Maskelyne told me he did with the
Davenports, sat with my eyes open and my mouth
shut. It is marvellous to see how excited we phlegmatic
islanders grow when either spirits are brought
to the front, or we think we have found out a conjuring
trick. I am not going to follow the example
of my gushing brethren, but I can safely say that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
anybody has an afternoon or evening to spare, he
may do worse than go to the Crystal Palace or the
Hanover Square Rooms, to see a very pretty and
indescribable phenomenon, and to return as I did, a
wiser, though perhaps a sadder man, in the proud
consciousness of having "found out how it is all
done."</p>

<h3>A LADY MESMERIST.</h3>


<p>When a man's whole existence has resolved itself into
hunting up strange people and poking his nose into
queer nooks and corners, he has a sorry time of it in
London during August; for, as a rule, all the funny
folks have gone out of town, and the queer nooks and
corners are howling wildernesses. There is always, of
course, a sort of borderland, if he can only find it out,
some peculiar people who never go out of town, some
strange localities which are still haunted by them;
only he has to find them out&mdash;people and places&mdash;for
it is so universally allowed now-a-days that all
genteel people must be out of London in August, and
all respectable places must be covered up in old newspapers,
that it is difficult to get them to own the soft
impeachment.</p>

<p>However, there is one queer place that is never shut
up, the Progressive Library in Southampton Row;
and Mr. Burns and the Spiritualists, as a rule, do not
shut up shop even in August. Their Summerland
lies elsewhere than Margate or the Moors; and a
valse with a pirouetting table or a little gentle levitation
or elongation delights them more than all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
revels of the countryside. I was getting a little blas&eacute;,
I own, on the subject of Spiritualism after my protracted
experiences during the Conference, and I do not
think I should have turned my steps in the direction
of the Progressive Institution that week had not the
following announcement caught my eye as I scanned
the ghostly pages of the <i>Medium and Daybreak</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>"<span class="smcap"><b>a mesmeric s&eacute;ance.</b></span></p>

<p>"We have been authorized to announce that Miss
Chandos, whose advertisement appears in another part
of this paper, will give a mesmeric s&eacute;ance at the
Spiritual Institution, 15, Southampton Row, on Wednesday
evening, August 19th, at eight o'clock. Admission
will be free by ticket, which may be obtained
at the Institution. The object which Miss Chandos
has in view is to interest a few truth-seekers who
could aid her in promoting a knowledge of psychological
phenomena. As a crowded meeting is not
desired, an early application should be made for
tickets."</p></div>

<p>I do not know that I said "Eureka!" Indeed I
have considerable historic doubts as to whether anybody
ever did, but I felt it. I was a truth-seeker
forthwith. I resolved to sit at the feet of Miss
Chandos, and, should her mesmeric efforts prove satisfactory,
"aid her in promoting a knowledge of
psychological phenomena." I did not go through
the prescribed process of getting a ticket beforehand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
because I thought in my innocence that everybody
would be out of town, or that the Hall of the Progressive
Institute would certainly accommodate those
who remained. Never was a more fatal mistake.
The psychological folks were all in London, and the
capacities of the Progressive Library are not palatial.
Miss Chandos had a crowded meeting whether she
desired it or not. Genius will not be concealed; and
Miss Chandos was learning that lesson in a very satisfactory
way. It was a sultry evening when a small
boy opened the back door of the little first floor
apartment in Southampton Row, and squeezed me in
like the thirteenth in an omnibus, and I found myself
walking on people's toes, and sitting down on their
hats in the most reckless manner. At length, however,
I struggled to a vacant corner, and deposited
myself perspiring and expectant.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns was "orating" on the revival mesmerism
was destined to make, and telling us how,
like the Plumstead Peculiars, we should be able to
do without doctors as soon as the healing powers of
animal magnetism were properly recognised and
diffused. I did not listen very carefully, I fear, for
I was nervously looking about for Miss Chandos.
Nervously, I say, because lady mediums and mesmerizers
are so apt to run to eighteen stone, or be old
and frumpish, that I had terrible fears lest I should
be scared when I met Miss Chandos in the flesh. I
was very agreeably surprised, however, for when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Mr. Burns resumed&mdash;not his chair but his table, since
he sat on that article of furniture, a very pretty
young lady indeed, of not more than eighteen or
twenty years of age, took his place, and, in a few
well-chosen words, said this was her first appearance
as a public mesmerist, and claimed indulgence should
any failure in the phenomena result. She also drew
attention to the fact that the apartment was "pernicious
snug" (she put it, of course, in more scientific
language), and straightway proceeded to business.</p>

<p>When Miss Chandos invited patients to put themselves
in her hands I thought the room had risen en
masse. Everybody wanted to be mesmerized. I had
no chance in my retired position; but she soon got a
front row of likely people, and I sat down once more
disappointed and exuding.</p>

<p>She was a tall active young lady was Miss Chandos,
and had a mystic crop of long black curls, which
waved about like the locks of a sibyl when she made
a lunge at an innocent looking young man who sat
No. 1&mdash;and whom, with the other patients, I shall
designate thus numerically. He seemed to like it
immensely, and smiled a fatuous smile as those taper
fingers lighted on his head, while the other hand
rested on the frontal portion of his face, as though
Miss Chandos were going to pull his nose. He was
off in a moment, and sat facing the audience in his
magnetic trance, looking like a figure at a waxwork
show. Miss Chandos then passed on to a gentleman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
No. 2, who never succumbed during the entire evening,
though she made several onslaughts upon him.
Consequently I dismiss No. 2 as incorrigible forthwith.
No. 3 was a lady who only gave way after a
lengthened attack, and did not seem to appreciate
the effect of Miss Chandos' lustrous eyes so much as
No. 1 did. He gave signs of "coming to," but
Miss Chandos kept looking round at him and No. 2,
while she was attending to No. 3, and directly she
did this No. 1 closed his eyes, and slept the sleep of
innocence again.</p>

<p>Having reduced No. 3 to a comatose condition Miss
Chandos reverted to No. 1, and by attractive passes
got him on his legs and made him follow her up and
down the limited space at her disposal. She looked
then like a pretty Vivien manipulating a youthful
Merlin; and I was not at all surprised at the effect of
her "woven paces and her waving hands." She asked
him his name, and he told her. It was W&mdash;&mdash;.
"No," she said, "it's Jones. Mary Jones. What's
your name?" But the youth was not quite so far
gone as to rebaptize himself with a female cognomen
just yet. He stuck to his W., and Miss Chandos put
him into his waxwork position again, and got No. 3
on her legs at last, but did nothing more with her
than make her walk up and down. Presently No. 3
woke up, and was put to air at the window.</p>

<p>No. 4 was now selected, in the person of a big
burly man; and I could not help thinking, as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
manipulated him, what a capital pose it would have
been for Hercules and Omphale. He seemed to like
it exceedingly, and I thought was dropping comfortably
off when he whispered something to his operator
(I have no notion what the feminine of that
word is), who fixed her brilliant eyes on somebody
near me&mdash;I feared it was actually on me&mdash;and said,
"Somebody at the back of the room is exercising control.
I shall be glad if they will refrain." I was
quite innocent of exercising conscious control, and did
not quite know what the phrase meant. I certainly
had once or twice thought it must be much pleasanter
to be operated upon by so pretty a young lady than
by some bull-necked male mesmerist or aged spinster
above-mentioned, but I could scarcely believe that such
a mild sentiment could affect that colossal man.
However, I recollected the delicacy of these psychological
relations, and sat down conscience-stricken and
warmer than ever.</p>

<p>Miss Chandos selected No. 5 in the person of a
young man with a nascent moustache, who had successfully
struggled into the front row at the outset.
He promised well at first; but, like other young men
with incipient moustaches, disappointed us afterwards.
Then came No. 6 upon the scene.</p>

<p>No. 6 was a lady who came late, and at once pushed
to the front with the air of a person who was not
doing so for the first time. She went off in a moment&mdash;far
too suddenly, in fact, and then did everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
she was told in a very obedient way. Being told that
she was in a beautiful garden, she stooped down on
the floral carpet and proceeded to gather materials for
a bouquet. I confess I did not care about No. 6, and
was proceeding to read Professor Tyndall's Belfast
Address, which I had in my pocket, when Miss
Chandos looked up No. 1 again.</p>

<p>Reduced to a proper frame of mind, either by Miss
Chandos' continued attentions or the contagion of
No. 6's docility, the youth was now all submission.
He walked up and down any number of times like a
tame animal at the Zoological Gardens, and now quite
agreed that his name was Mary Jones. He sang
"Tom Bowling" at command, and No. 6, not to be
outdone, warbled a ditty called, I think, "The Slave
Girl's Love," the refrain of which, according to her
version, was, "I cannot love, because I <i>ham</i> a slave."
She broke down in the middle of this aspiring ditty,
and then personated a Jew old clo' man, a woman
selling "ornaments for your firestoves," and various
other characters, all of which she overacted considerably.
I may be wrong, of course, but I fancied the
fair lecturess was as dissatisfied with No. 6 as I was.
The audience was an indulgent one, and thought it
splendid. Mr. Burns sat on the table and yawned. I
relapsed into Tyndall, and wondered what he would
have said about it all; or, at least, I did not wonder,
for I knew he would have consigned us all to the
nearest lunatic asylum as exceptions to the rule that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the European has so many more cubic inches of cerebral
development than the Papuan.</p>

<p>When it was drawing near ten, Miss Chandos
brought the proceedings to a close by animating&mdash;like
Pygmalion&mdash;her waxwork statues. She apologized
once more, in a few well-chosen sentences, for
what she was pleased to call her "failure," but the
audience would not hear of the term, and applauded
to the echo, only there was no room for an echo in
the Progressive Institute. The young man, No. 1,
who I found was a spirit medium, wound up by an
address from his Indian guide on the subject of
"control."</p>

<p>I confess I failed to gather from the perambulating
youth and maidens No. 1 and 3, or the impersonations
of No. 6, any signs of the revival alluded to by Mr.
Burns at the outset; and there was not the remotest
connexion with the healing art. In fact, nobody
seemed suffering from anything except heat.</p>

<p>Miss Chandos said to me, however, in a sensible
conversation with which she favoured me in private,
that all she had attempted to show was but the
lowest manifestation of a power which had far
higher ends in view. She doubted almost whether
it was not something like sacrilege to use such a
power for playing tricks and gratifying curiosity.</p>

<p>She was thoroughly in earnest; and laboured
both physically during the evening and logically
in her after-discourse, with an energy which some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
persons would have said was worthy of a better
cause.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven when I left the miniature hall
of the Progressive Institute, and as I passed along
the streets, digesting what I had seen and heard
during the evening, I took myself to task severely&mdash;as
it is always well to do, if only to prevent somebody
else doing it for me&mdash;and asked whether, if the
lecturess had not been a lecturess but a lecturer&mdash;if
being a lecturess she weighed eighteen stone, or was
old and wizen, or dropped her h's&mdash;whether I should
have stayed three mortal hours in that stuffy room,
and I frankly own I came to the conclusion I should
<i>not</i>.</p>

<h3>A PSYCHOPATHIC INSTITUTION.</h3>


<p>Reading my <i>Figaro</i> the other day&mdash;as I hope I need
not state it is my custom devoutly to do&mdash;I came
upon the following passage in the review of a book
called "Psychopathy; or, the True Healing Art.
By Joseph Ashman. London: Burns, Southampton
Row. We have not the pleasure of being personally
acquainted with Joseph Ashman, and we fear that
the loss is ours. Judging him through the medium
of his book, he must, indeed, be a rara avis....
The one great thing," it went on to say, "that
Joseph Ashman wants the world to know is, that he
cures disease by very simple means. And all that
the world wants to know from Joseph Ashman is,
Are these cures real&mdash;are his statements facts? Why,
then, does not Joseph content himself with his facts?
He has plenty of them. Here is one:&mdash;'Seeing one
day a cabman with a swollen face standing by a police-court
ready to prosecute a man who had assaulted
him, I asked if, on condition I healed him, he would
forgive his adversary. He replied that he would, and
we accordingly got into his cab together. Bringing
out the magnetized carte, I told him to look at it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and at the same time made a few motions over the
swelling with my hand. I then left him feeling much
better, and returned in an hour's time, when I found
him taking a glass of beer with his antagonist, whom
he had forgiven.'"</p>

<p>Now as the one pursuit and end of my present
existence is the discovery of rar&aelig; aves, I need not say
I at once took up the clue herein afforded, and went
in pursuit of Joseph Ashman. I found not only him
but his institution, for Mr. Ashman does not work
single-handed. It is in the Marylebone Road, almost
opposite the Yorkshire Stingo; and is most modest
and unpretending in its outward semblance, being
situated in one of those semi-rustic houses so indicative
of suburban London, down an overstocked garden,
into which you enter by means of a blistered iron
gate, painted violently green, and swinging heavily on
its hinges. Down a vista of decrepit dahlias one
sped to the portal, alongside which was a trio of
bell-handles, one above the other, showing that the
Psychopathic Institution did not occupy the whole
even of that modest domicile. I always approach
these manifold bells with considerable diffidence,
conscious that I must inevitably ring the wrong one;
so, on this occasion, I rang none at all, but knocked
a faint double knock on the knocker by way of compromise&mdash;very
faint, indeed, lest I should disturb any
patients who were being "psychopathized." While I
waited I had leisure to observe that hidden among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the dahlias, and thatched over as it were with a
superannuated costermonger's barrow, was a double
perambulator, which set me calculating the probabilities
of Mr. Ashman being a family man.</p>

<p>The door was opened before I had settled the point
to my own mental satisfaction, by a short, cheery-looking
man, with long, straight flaxen hair flowing
down over the shoulders of his black frock-coat, a
beard a few shades lighter, and a merry twinkling
eye, which looked more sympathetic than psychopathic,
and I should think was calculated to do
patients good directly it lighted on them. He looked
as much as to ask whether I was psychopathically
wrong, when I informed him that I had not come as
a patient, but simply to inspect his institution if he
would permit me. The permission was at once
accorded. "We are hard at work," he said, as he
ushered me into the front parlour; "but come in and
see what we are about."</p>

<p>A man who looked like a respectable artisan was
sitting at the table; and a second, in his shirt sleeves,
was astride of a chair in what appeared to be rather
an idiotic ride-a-cock-horse-to-Banbury-Cross fashion,
and Mr. Ashman was pinching him and prodding him
as butchers do fat animals at the Smithfield Show.</p>

<p>"That there gentleman," said Mr. Ashman, in a
broad provincial dialect, "couldn't get astride that
chair when he come here half-an-hour ago. How d'ye
feel now, sir?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Feel as though I should like to race somebody
twenty rods for five pound a-side," answered the
patient, getting up and walking about the room as if
it were a new sensation. He had been brought, it
appeared, to Mr. Ashman by his friend, who was
sitting at the table, and who was an old psychopathic
patient. He assured me he had suffered from
rheumatism for twenty years, and was completely
disabled without his stick until he came into that
room half-an-hour since. He walked up and down
stickless and incessantly as the carnivora at the Zoo
all the time he was telling me.</p>

<p>"Would you mind putting your ear to this man's
back, sir?" said Mr. Ashman to me. I did so; and
when he bent, his backbone seemed to go off with a
lot of little cracks like the fog-signals of a railway.
"That there old rusty hinge we mean to grease."
And away he went psychopathizing him again. When
he was done, Mr. Ashman explained to me learnedly,
and with copious illustrations from anatomical plates,
his theory of this disease, which was his favourite
one for treatment, because it yielded rapidly. Paralysis
and that class of disease are much slower. He had
succeeded in acute rheumatism, and also in calculus.
"I like fat men&mdash;fighting men to heal," he said. "I
leave the delicate ones to others." The sturdy little
psychopathist looked healthy enough to heal a sick
rhinoceros.</p>

<p>While he was lecturing me his hands were not idle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
I should think they seldom were. He was pouring
salad oil from a flask on to flannel to give to the other
man who was sitting at the table, and had approached
convalescence from a chronic disease after one or two
visits, and who used this oiled flannel to keep up the
influence. Both the men seemed perfectly genuine;
and the rheumatic gentleman, when he left, pronounced
the effect of his psychopathizing miraculous. The fee
was five shillings. "I shan't charge you nothin' for
the flannel," he said to No. 2. I began to take quite
a fancy to Joseph Ashman, and thanked <i>Figaro</i> inwardly
for directing me to the institution.</p>

<p>A working woman who was next in the little row
of patients assembled in the back room, came in with
her wrists bound up in bits of flannel, and her hands
looking puffed and glazy. She, too, had lost the use
of them for six years, she told me, and had been pronounced
incurable by the doctors. This was her
fourth visit to Mr. Ashman. "Take up the chair,
ma'am," he said to his patient; and she did carry it
in rather a wobbly fashion across the room. "Now
the other hand," and she did it with the other hand.
"Now show the gentleman how you did it when you
came to me. She's rather hard o' hearin'," he explained
to me; but after one or two repetitions the
poor old body comprehended, and carried it in her
crooked elbow. "Now I'll call my assistant," he
said, and summoned a ruddy, red-bearded man, who
looked as though he might have just come in from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
brisk country walk. "When these cases require a
good deal of rubbing I let my assistants do the preliminary
work, and then come in as the Healing
Medium myself." The rubbers, he informed me, like
the Medium, must be qualified, not only physically,
but morally. Benevolence was the great requisite;
and certainly both these men seemed running over
with it, if looks meant anything. When Joseph
Ashman took his turn, working the poor old patient's
stiff wrists, and pulling her fingers till they cracked,
like children playing "sweethearts," she never winced,
but actually seemed to like it, and trotted off well
satisfied with her fourth instalment of good health.</p>

<p>The next rubber who was introduced to me was
not such a ruddy man, being, in fact, somewhat
saturnine in appearance; but I could quite understand
that he was, as he described himself, brimful of electricity.
His chevelure was like that on the little
man we stick on the conductor of an electrical machine
and make each particular hair stand on end like
quills upon the fretful porcupine.</p>

<p>I could not for the life of me see the difference
between this treatment and simple mesmerism, except
that it was much more rapid in its effects than any
magnetic treatment I have ever witnessed. Indeed,
I frankly confess I do not understand it now, though
Mr. Ashman made me accept one of his little books
on Psychopathic healing, and told me I should see
the distinction when I had read it. I must be very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
dense, for I have read it diligently through, and still
fail to trace the distinction.</p>

<p>The man made a great impression on me. I felt
he was just one of those who would carry life into a
sick room, and communicate vital power&mdash;supposing
it to be communicable&mdash;from the dumpy fingers of
his fat soft hand. The perambulator did not belie
him. Numbers of pretty black-eyed children were
running about, and there was a Mrs. Ashman somewhere
among the poor patients in the back room.
All the children came to me except the eldest boy,
who, his father told me in a mysterious tone, had
suffered some indignity at the hands of my cloth, and
dreaded a parson ever after. I believe my injudicious
brother had set him a long task (perhaps his Duty to
his Neighbour), and the poor lad was always afraid
he should be dropped down upon to "say it." Mr.
Ashman's book is a little bewildering to an outsider
who fails to distinguish the <i>two</i> vital forces. He
says: "It is much rarer to find a high development
of a temperament in which the psychical element
prevails, than in which it is well blended with the
vital-magnetic, or than in which the latter excels.
In nearly all popular public men there is a blending
of the two. We see it well exemplified in John
Bright, Spurgeon, and others. This is the secret of
their drawing, magnetic power. It is the secret, too,
of many a physician's success: his genial magnetism
cures when his medicine is useless, although, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
he does not know it. As is the difference between
these two forces, so is the difference in the method of
their employment for the purpose of cure." However,
when I left I promised&mdash;and I mean to keep
my vow&mdash;that if ever I am unfortunate enough to
find my vertebr&aelig; creaking like "an old hinge," I
will come to Mr. Ashman and have it greased. The
remark in his book as to the success of medicine
depending on the qualities of him who administered
it was, we may recollect, confirmed at the 1874 meeting
of the British Association in Belfast.</p>

<p>Joseph Ashman has had a chequered history. He
has dwelt in the tents of the Mormonites; has been
one of the Peculiar People. In early life he was in
service in the country, where his master used to flog
him until, to use his own expression, he nearly cut
him in two. His earliest patients were cattle. "For
a healer," he said, "give me a man as can clean a
window or scrub a floor. Christ himself, when He
chose those who were to be healers as well as
preachers, chose fishermen, fine, deep chested men, depend
upon it, sir," and he rapped upon his own sonorous
lungs until they reverberated. He was certainly
blessed with a superabundance of good health, and
looked benevolent enough to impart all his surplus
stock to anybody who wanted it.</p>

<h3>A PHRENOLOGICAL EVENING.</h3>


<p>The experience I am about to chronicle occurred
when the Beecher-Tilton scandal was at its height;
and I was attracted by the somewhat ambiguous
title "Burns upon Beecher."</p>

<p>Mr. James Burns, the spirited proprietor of the
Progressive Library, Southampton Row, having devoted
himself to the study of phrenology, has for
some time past held a series of craniological s&eacute;ances
on Tuesday evenings, at which he "takes off" the
head of some well-known person, or your own, if you
like, whether you are well-known or born to blush
unseen, not in the way of physical decapitation, but
by the method of phrenological diagnosis. I greatly
regretted having, on a previous occasion, missed the
analysis of Dr. Kenealy's cerebral developments. I
believe the Claimant himself was once the object of
Mr. Burns' remarks; but when Mr. Beecher's cranium
was laid down for dissection at the height of the
Beecher-Tilton sensation, I could resist no longer,
but, despite all obstacles, repaired to the Institute of
Progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>About a score of people were gathered in that first-floor
front where I had seen so many strange things.
Of these persons some formed the regular phrenological
class conducted there weekly by Mr. Burns.
The others were, generally speaking, of the ordinary
lecture-audience type. One stout lady occupied an
easy-chair in a corner, and slept from first to last.</p>

<p>The first part of the lecture was a little discursive,
I fancy for my especial benefit, and summarized Mr.
Burns' system, which is to a great extent original.
Beginning by a disavowal of all dogmas, he began
by advancing what was to me the entirely novel
doctrine, that the brain was not the sole organ of the
mind, but that the whole organism of man had to be
taken into account in the diagnosis of character, since
the entire body was permeated with the mind. The
bones, fluids, and viscera were all related to mental phenomena.
The lecturer even questioned whether the
science he promulgated was properly termed phrenology.
It certainly did not answer to the conventional
idea of that craft. Referring to a calico diagram
which was pinned to the curtains of the first-floor
front, and at which he pointed with a walking-stick,
Mr. Burns notified four divisions of the animal frame&mdash;1,
the vital organs; 2, the mechanical; 3, the
nervous (which in the lower orders were ganglionic
only); 4, the cerebral apparatus. He defended the
animal powers from the debased idea usually attached
to them, and pointed out their close connexion with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the spirit, nearer to which they were placed than any
portion of the economy.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to apply his preliminary remarks
to preachers in general. Theodore Parker, for
instance, was a man of spare body and large brain.
He was surrounded by intellectual people, and his
disciples were quite sui generis. On the other hand,
Spurgeon was a man of strong animal and perceptive
powers, and so able to send the Walworth shopkeepers
into ecstasies. His ganglions were big, as
was the case in all great preachers. Emotion, he
said, was more a matter of bowels than of brain.
The ganglionic power carried the brain; but there
were, of course, combinations of all grades.</p>

<p>In the case of Henry Ward Beecher, two of whose
photographs he held in his hand, he dwelt on the
disadvantage of having only the shadow instead of
the substance of his head to deal with. Here, he
said, we had all the elements on a large scale. The
brain, thoracic system, osseous structure, and abdominal
development were all in excess. The face
was, as it were, the picture of all. Henry Ward
Beecher was emphatically a large man. The blood
was positive; the circulation good. The digestion
was perfect, and the man enjoyed good food. Especially
the length from the ear to the front of the
eyebrows denoted intellectual grasp. There was not
much will power. Whatever he had done (and Mr.
Burns emphatically disclaimed passing any judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the "scandal") he had not done of determination,
but had rather "slid into it." He was no planner.
He gathered people round him by the "solar" force
of his mind. If he had been a designing man&mdash;if
largely developed behind the ears&mdash;he would have
gone to work in a different way. There was good
development in the intellectual, sympathetic, and
emotional part of his nature; and this combination
made him a popular preacher. There was
more than mere animal magnetism needed to account
for this; there was intellectual power, but not much
firmness or conscientiousness. If he were present,
he would probably acknowledge that something had
led him on to do whatever he had done in spite of
himself. What was very peculiar in the man was
his youthfulness. He had been before the world for
forty years. Mr. Fowler, the phrenologist, of Ludgate
Circus, had been a fellow student of Beecher,
and had measured his head, which he ascertained to
have grown an inch in ten years. Beecher was essentially
a growing man&mdash;growing like a boy. The
ganglionic power was that which kept people always
growing, and was the great means of their getting a
hold over other people.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns then passed in review the three portraits
of Beecher, Tilton, and Mrs. Tilton respectively, in
the <i>Pictorial World</i>. Mrs. Tilton he described as a
negative person, inclined to be hysterical and
"clinging." There was in her a high type of brain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
morally, intellectually, and spiritually. Still the
brain, he said, did not make us good or bad. Again
repudiating all judgment as to the scandal, he dwelt
upon the close social relationships between Beecher
and Mrs. Tilton, and recurred to the strong vital influence
of the former, comparing it to that of Brigham
Young upon his "spiritual affinities." In all
probability, taking into account the different natures
of Beecher and Mrs. Tilton, whatever had occurred
"the people couldn't help themselves."</p>

<p>Then as to Theodore Tilton. Mr. Burns had read
the <i>Golden Age</i>, and pronounced it a smart publication.
There was, however, in Tilton a want of ganglionic
power; he was all brain. He was a man who might
be read, but he could not lecture or preach. His was
a higher mind than Beecher's, but not one that
would command much human sympathy.</p>

<p>Suppose Mrs. Tilton were not the wife of either,
her relations to each might be conscientious, but still
violate the laws of monogamic life. The influence
of Beecher over her would be ganglionic as well as
intellectual; that of Tilton purely intellectual: when
lo, a gust of ganglionic power would supervene on
the latter, and carry all before it.</p>

<p>Concluding his analysis of Mr. Beecher thus, Mr.
Burns discovered that he had two clerics among his
audience, and asked us&mdash;for I was one of them&mdash;if
we would be examined. I readily consented, and
handed my notes to Miss Chandos (the young lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
mesmerist, whose s&eacute;ance I reported a few pages back)
to report progress. She, therefore, is responsible for
the diagnosis that follows.</p>

<p>Handling me from head to foot, much as a fancier
does a prize ox at Smithfield, Mr. Burns found the
life power good, and the muscles well nourished, the
working faculties being in a high state of activity.
The head&mdash;I blushed to hear&mdash;measured one inch
beyond the average of a man of my size, and the
cerebral faculties were harmoniously organized. I
had large perceptive powers; and my human nature
(wherever that may be located) was full, as was also
firmness. The thinking sphere was good. I should
have made, Mr. Burns informed me, a good sculptor
or artist.</p>

<p>Omitting one or two complimentary remarks which
Miss Chandos has faithfully, if not flatteringly, reported,
and the enunciation of which quite confused
me as I sat the centre and cynosure of that wondering
group, I was glad to learn that I was an open
man, though possessed of sufficient caution and not
defective in moral courage. In fact "pluck" was
large. I really wished Mr. Burns would relieve me
by finding some bad bumps; but no&mdash;the worst he
could say of me was that I was restless. What
chiefly seemed to strike him, though, were my vital
powers, and he really covered me with confusion
when he began to calculate my Beecher powers on a
possible Mrs. Tilton. However, he toned down this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
remark by noticing that my domestic faculties were
well developed. My faith and hope were small. I
was a "doubting" man. The positive and negative
were well blent in me, and I was also "mediumistic."</p>

<p>The diagnosis of two ladies concluded the evening's
exercises, but neither of these personages displayed
any very remarkable traits; Mr. Burns declaring he
felt some difficulty in discovering the bumps under
the "back hair."</p>

<h3>A SPIRITUAL PICNIC.</h3>


<p>In a volume bearing the title of <i>Mystic London</i> it
would seem perchance that Spiritualism, as par excellence
the modern mystery, should stand first. I have
thought it better, however, to defer its treatment
somewhat, working up to it as to a climax, and then
gently descending to mundane matters once more ere
I close my present work.</p>

<p>Of London at this hour, just as of Rome in the later
Republic and Empire, it may be safely affirmed that
there is in its midst an element of the mysterious and
occult utterly undreamed of by the practical people.
Many phases of this element have already been treated
of in my different works; and I add some of the more
exceptional as properly belonging to my present subject.</p>

<p>Now I candidly confess that, up to a recent date, I
had not given Spiritualists&mdash;qu&acirc; spiritualists&mdash;credit
for being a cheerful or convivial people. Though
there exist upon the tablets of my memory recollections
of certain enjoyable dinners, cosy teas, and charming
petits soupers, eaten at the mahogany of believers in
the modern mystery, yet these were purely exceptional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
events, oases in the desert of spiritualistic experiences.
Generally speaking, the table, instead of groaning
under its accumulated bounties, leapt about as if from
the absence thereof; and the only adjuncts of the inhospitable
mahogany were paper tubes for the spirit
voices, handbells for the spirit hands, and occasional
accordions and musical boxes for the delectation of
harmonious ghosts. It was a "flow of soul" if not
always a "feast of reason;" but, as regarded creature
comforts, or any of the ordinary delights of mundane
existence, a very Siberian desert. A grave subject of
discussion (I am not, I assure you, indulging in a
sepulchral pun) at the recent Liverpool Conference
was how to feed mediums, and I fancy the preponderating
opinion was that fasting was a cardinal
virtue in their case&mdash;a regimen that had come to be
in my mind, perhaps unfairly, associated with s&eacute;ances
in general. I was glad, therefore, when I read in the
columns of the <i>Medium</i> the announcement of the
spiritual picnic or "demonstration," at the People's
Garden, Willesden. Still I wanted to see Spiritualists
enjoy themselves in the "normal condition." I sympathized
with the avowed object of the gathering, that
the followers of the new creed should know one
another, as surely the disciples of a common school
ought to do. Armed, therefore, with a ticket, I proceeded,
vi&acirc; the North London Railway, to the scene
of action. It was not what we materialistic people
should call a fine August day. It was cold and dull,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and tried hard to rain; but it was far more in keeping
with the character of the meeting than what Father
Newman calls the "garish day" one looks for in mid-August.
In the words of the circle the "conditions
were excellent;" and as I journeyed on, reading my
<i>Medium</i> like a true believer, I marvelled to see, by the
evidence of its advertisements, how the new creed had
taken hold of a certain section, at all events, of society.
Besides a dozen public mediums who paraded their
varied attractions at terms ranging from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
21<i>s.</i>, there were spiritualistic young men who put
forward their creed as a qualification for clerkships&mdash;perhaps
they had no other claim&mdash;spiritual lodging-house
keepers, and even spiritual undertakers, all pervaded
by what we may literally call a common esprit
de corps.</p>

<p>In due course we reached the People's Garden, the
popular title whereof seemed to have been given on
the lucus a non principle, for the London folk have
not, as yet, affected it largely. Why this should be
so one cannot guess, for it is the very ideal of a Cockney
Paradise, and is admirably worked by a body of
shareholders, most of whom belong to the artisan
class, though under very distinguished patronage
indeed. When I got to the grounds the Spiritualists
were indulging in a merry-go-round during a refreshing
drizzle. A temporary rush under cover ensued, and
then the weather became more favourable, though the
skies preserved their neutral tint. Mrs. Bullock, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
suburban medium, who had become entranced, had
located herself in a bower, and beckoned people from
the audience to receive her "benediction," which was
given in a remarkable dialect. I thought it was
Yorkshire, but a spiritualistic gentleman explained to
me that it was "partly North American Indian."
The Osborne Bellringers next gave a campanological
concert, which was exceedingly good of its kind, the
small gentleman who played the bass bell working so
actively as to suggest the idea that he could not long
survive such hard labour in his fleshly condition.
These campanologists are said to be big mediums, and
occasionally to be floated or otherwise spirited during
their performances; but nothing abnormal occurred
at the People's Garden. Then there was dancing on
the monster platform, which is, I should think, correctly
described as "the largest in the world." This
was indeed a new phase of Spiritualism: the terpsichorean
spiritualists generally let their tables do the
dancing for them, as Eastern potentates hire their
dancing-girls. Donkey-races, croquet, and other unspiritual
diversions varied the order of proceedings;
and as for the one-and-ninepenny teas, I can only say
I should think the Garden Committee did not get
much profit out of them, for the Spiritualists regaled
themselves in the most material fashion. During the
afternoon the arrivals were fast and frequent. All the
medium-power of London seemed present; and the
only wonder was that we were not all floated bodily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
away. There was Mrs. Guppy, who, in answer to my
demand whether she had been "floated" from Highbury,
informed me that she had come far less romantically&mdash;"nine
in a cab!" There was Dr. Monk, too,
a Nonconformist clergyman, who had lately been
taking a&euml;rial journeys of the Guppy order about
Bristol. In fact, the &eacute;lite of the sect were well represented;
and during the whole afternoon, despite the
dirty-looking day, the fun was fast and furious, and
all went merry as the proverbial marriage-bell.</p>

<p>Part of the programme was an entertainment by a
gentleman bearing the delightfully sepulchral name of
Dr. Sexton, whose mission in life it is to "expose"
the tricks of Dr. Lynn and Messrs. Maskelyne and
Cooke. How those gentlemen are to be "exposed,"
seeing they only claim to deceive you by legerdemain,
I cannot comprehend; but they made the Spiritualists
very angry by taking their names in vain on the handbills
of the Egyptian Hall, and more than insinuating
that there was a family likeness between their performances;
and, consequently, the conjurors were to
be "exposed;" that is, the public were to have their
visit to the Temple of Magic spoilt by being shown
beforehand how the tricks were done. Aided by an
expert assistant named Organ, Dr. Sexton soon let us
into the mysteries of the cabinet business, which
seemed just as easy as making the egg stand on end&mdash;when
you know how. It is perfectly true that,
after hearing Dr. Sexton's exposition&mdash;rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
expos&eacute;&mdash;it is quite easy for any one to frustrate the
designs of these clever conjurors, if he wishes to do
so. I am not sure that the expos&eacute; is wise. Illogical
people will not see the force of Dr. Sexton's argument,
and will possibly think it "proves too much." If so
much can be done by sleight of hand and ingenious
machinery, they will argue, perhaps, that the Davenports
and other mediums are only cleverer conjurors
still, or have better machinery. Alas! all my fairyland
is pasteboard now. I know how the man gets
out of the corded box&mdash;I could do it myself. I know
where the gorilla goes when he seems lost in the
magic cabinet. It is all a clever combination of mirrors.
The blood-red letters of some dear departed
friend are only made with red ink and a quill pen, and
the name of the "dear departed" forged. Well, I
suppose <i>I</i> am illogical, too. If one set of things is so
simple when it is shown to you, why may not all be?
I fear the Willesden outing has unsettled my convictions,
and shaken my faith in most sublunary things.</p>

<p>The gathering clearly proved the growth of Spiritualism
in London. That such numbers could be got
together in the dead season bespeaks a very extensive
ramification indeed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>A GHOSTLY CONFERENCE.</h3>


<p>A distinct and well-marked epoch is reached in the
history of any particular set of opinions when its
adherents begin to organize and confer, and the individual
tenets become the doctrines of a party. Such
a culmination has been attained by the believers in
Modern Spiritualism. For a long while after the
date of the now historical Rochester Rappings, the
manifestations were mostly individual, and in a great
degree limited to such exercises as Mr. Home's elongation,
Mrs. Guppy's flight from Highbury to Lamb's
Conduit Street, or, more recently still, the voices and
manipulations of John and Katie King, the orations
of Mrs. Hardinge, Mr. Morse, and Mrs. Tappan.
But all this was spasmodic, and not likely to take
the world by storm, while Spiritualists had adopted
the time-honoured maxim&mdash;"Magna est veritas et
prevalebit." Therefore they must organize. They
have done so, not without protest on the part of some
of the most noted of their adherents; but the majority
carried the day, and the result is the British National
Association of Spiritualists, which has recently been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
sitting in solemn conclave at its first Annual Conference
in Lawson's Rooms, Gower Street.</p>

<p>Now I plead guilty to being greatly interested in
this subject of Spiritualism generally, and in the
doings of the Conference in particular. I cannot
help thinking that clergymen and scientists ought to
look into any set of opinions whose professors have
attained the dimensions of this body. Their doctrines
have spread and are spreading. Already the
Spiritualists number among them such men as Mr.
Alfred Wallace, Mr. Varley, Mr. Crookes, Mr. S. C.
Hall, &amp;c., and are extending their operations amongst
all classes of society, notably among the higher. I
could even name clergymen of all denominations who
hold Spiritualistic views, but refrain, lest it should
seem invidious, though I cannot see why it should be
incongruous for the clergy to examine doctrines which
profess to amplify rather than supplant those of revelation,
any more than I can why scientists stand aloof
from what professes to be a purely positive philosophy,
based upon the inductive method. So it is, however;
Spiritualism is heterodox at once in its religious and
philosophical aspects. I suppose that is why it had
such special attraction for me. Certain it is, I have
been following the ghostly conference like a devotee.</p>

<p>We began on Monday evening with a musical soir&eacute;e
at the Beethoven Rooms, in Harley Street; and there
was certainly nothing ghostly or sepulchral in our
opening day; only then there was nothing very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
spiritualistic either. For a long time I thought it
was going to be all tea and muffins and pianoforte.
By-and-by, however, Mr. Algernon Joy read a report
of the organization, which was rather more interesting
than reports generally are, and Mr. Benjamin Coleman,
a venerable gentleman, the father of London Spiritualists,
delivered a Presidential address. Still
there were no ghosts&mdash;not even a spirit rap to
augment the applause which followed the speakers.
Once my hopes revived when two new physical
mediums, with letters of recommendation from
Chicago, were introduced, and I expected to see the
young gentlemen elongate or float round the room;
but nothing of the kind occurred; and a young lady
dashed my hopes to the ground by singing "The
Nightingale's Trill." Mr. Morse gave an address in
the trance state&mdash;as I was afterwards informed; but he
looked and spoke so like an ordinary mortal that I
should not have found out that he was in an abnormal
condition.</p>

<p>I fear I went home from Harley Street not quite
in so harmonious a frame of mind as could have been
wished.</p>

<p>The next morning (Wednesday) Dr. Gully presided
at the opening of the Conference proper in Gower
Street, where the rooms were more like vaults and
smelt earthy. The President ably enough summarized
the objections which had been raised to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Association, and also the objects it proposed to itself.
He said:&mdash;"If the Association keeps clear of dogmatic
intrusion, then will there be no fear of its
becoming sectarian. Already, however, there is a
signal of dogmatism among Spiritualists&mdash;and
already the dogmatizers call themselves by another
name. But the Association has nothing to do with
this. It knows its function to be the investigation
of facts, and of facts only; and, as was said, no sect
was ever yet framed on undoubted facts. Now what
are the facts of Spiritualism up to this date? They
are reducible to two:&mdash;1st. The continued life and
individuality of the spirit body of man after it has
quitted its body of flesh; and, 2nd. Its communion
with spirits still in the flesh, under certain conditions,
by physical exhibition and mental impression. Spirit
identity cannot be regarded yet as an established fact&mdash;at
all events, not so as to warrant us in building
upon it."</p>

<p>I was agreeably surprised with the moderate tone of
this address; and after a brief theological discussion,
Mr. W. H. Harrison, the editor of the <i>Spiritualist</i>,
followed with a paper on Organization. I do not
know what Mr. Harrison was not for organizing.
Libraries, reading-rooms, colleges, everything was to
be spiritualized. Later in the day there was a paper
on Physical Manifestations. I should have preferred
the manifestations without the paper, for I fear I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a poor believer at second hand. The reader told some
"stumping" stories. Here is one as a specimen&mdash;spiritual
in more senses than one:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One evening I accompanied the Davenports to
Mr. Guppy's residence in Great Marlborough Street.
After supper Ira, the eldest of the brothers, Mr.
Guppy, and myself, adjourned to a dark room, which
Mr. Guppy had had prepared for experimental purposes.
To get to this room we had to pass through
a room that served the combined purposes of a
sculptor's studio and a billiard room. Emerging from
this room we came into a yard, in one corner of which
the dark cabinet in question was constructed.
Taking our seats, we extinguished the light. Mr.
Guppy was at the time smoking a cigar. This was
at once taken from his hand, and carried in the air,
where it could be seen by the light given out by its
combustion. Some whisky and water was standing
on the table. This was handed to us to drink. When
it came to my turn, I found there was but little left
in the glass. This I pointed out. The glass was
forthwith taken from my mouth, and replenished and
brought back again."</p>

<p>On Thursday Mr. Everitt read a paper on Direct
Writing by Spirits, telling us that on one occasion
nine hundred and thirty-six words were written in six
seconds. Mr. Everitt must be a bold man&mdash;I don't
mean altogether for asking us to believe that, but for
saying what he did about the medium, who was his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wife:&mdash;"There are many considerations why it would
be impossible for the medium to have produced these
writings. For instance, we have sixteen papers upon
the same subject, and in those papers there are a
great many ancient authors referred to. Mrs. Everitt
has never read or seen a single book of any of these
authors, and, with a few exceptions, their names had
never been heard by her before, much less did she
know the age they lived in, the country they belonged
to, the works they had written, or the arguments
made use of for the defence of their doctrines and
teachings. Besides the above reasons there are physical
and mental difficulties which preclude the possibility
of their being produced by the medium. The
physical impossibility is the marvellous rapidity of
their production, as many as 936 words having been
written in six seconds. The mental difficulty is that
the medium has not a logical mind. Like most
females, she takes a short cut by jumping to conclusions.
She does not, indeed cannot, argue out any
proposition by the ordinary rules of logic. Now the
papers referred to show that the author or authors
are not only well acquainted with ancient lore and
the classics, but also possessed very high ability as
logicians. For the above reasons we conclude that
the medium, from sheer incapacity, both mentally
and physically, could not have written these papers,
nor any other human being under the same circumstances.
We are therefore absolutely driven, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
looking at the subject from every conceivable point of
view, to conclude respecting their production that
they came from a supernatural source, and were produced
by supernatural means."</p>

<p>In the afternoon of this day a clergyman, whose
name it would be highly indecorous in me to mention,
descanted on the aspect of Spiritualism from his point
of view in the Church of England. I understood the
purport of the paper to be (1) that he claimed the
right of members of the Church of England to investigate
the phenomena; (2) that, if convinced of their
spiritual origin, such conviction need not shake the
investigator's previous faith. If the clergyman in
question really said no more than the printed reports
of the Conference represent him to have done, he
rather reversed the conduct of Balaam, and cursed
those he came to bless. This is the curt r&eacute;sum&eacute; that
went forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Rev. &mdash;&mdash; read a paper, in which he defined
his position with regard to Spiritualism as that of a
mere inquirer, adding that even if he became convinced
of its truth, he saw no reason why he should
alter the opinions he at present held as a clergyman
of the Church of England. After eighteen months'
inquiry into the subject, however, he was, perhaps,
more of a sceptic than before." If that was all the
clergyman in question had to say for the Association,
they must rather regret they ever "organized" him,
and might well pray to be saved from their friends;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
but I heard it whispered&mdash;presumably by a spirit
voice&mdash;that there had been a passage at arms between
the lady secretary and the clergyman in question, and
that Miss&mdash;but no, I must not mention names&mdash;the
fair official punished the delinquent that most
awful penalty&mdash;silence.</p>

<p>Friday finished the Conference with a trance paper&mdash;I
did not know there were such things&mdash;dictated to
Mrs. Cora Tappan by invisible guides, and was read
by Miss&mdash;I mean by the fair incognita above-mentioned.
Not a manifestation&mdash;literally not the ghost
of one&mdash;only this very glowing peroration:&mdash;"But it
is in a larger sense of social, mental, political, and
even religious renovation, that Spiritualism is destined
to work its chief results. The abrogation of
the primal terror of mankind, the most ancient spectre
in the world of thought, grim and shadowy Death, is,
in itself, so vital a change that it constitutes a revolution
in the world of mind. Chemistry has already
revealed the wonderful fact that no ultimate atom can
perish. The subtle chemistry of Spiritualism steps in
where science ceases, gathering up the ultimate atoms
of thought into a spiritual entity and proving them
imperishable. Already has this thought pervaded
the popular mind, tinged the decaying forms of
theology and external science with its glow, and made
the life of man a heritage of immortal glory. More
than this, taking spirit as the primal basis of life,
each individual, and all members of society and hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>manity
in the aggregate, must for ever strive to express
its highest life (i.e. the life of the spirit). The child
will be taught from within, external methods being
employed only as aids, but never as dictators of thought.
Society will be the flowing out of spiritual truths,
taking shape and substance as the expression of the
soul. Governments will be the protecting power of a
parent over loving children, instead of the dictates of
force or tyranny. Religion will wear its native garb
of simplicity and truth, the offspring of the love and
faith that gave it birth. Modern Spiritualism is as
great a solvent of creeds, dogmas, codes, scientific
sophisms, as is the sunlight of the substances contained
in earth and air, revealing by the stages of
intermediate life, from man, through spirits, angels,
archangels, seraphim, and cherubim, to God, the
glorious destiny of every soul. There is a vine growing
in the islands of the tropic seas that thrives best
upon the ancient ruins or crumbling walls of some
edifice built by man; yet ever as it thrives, the tiny
tendrils penetrate between the fibres of the stone,
cutting and cutting till the whole fabric disappears,
leaving only the verdant mass of the foliage of the
living vine. Spiritualism is to the future humanity
what this vine is to the ancient ruin."</p>

<p>There was another paper coming on "Compound
Consciousness," but the title did not attract me.
After my four days' patient waiting for ghosts who
never came and spirits that would not manifest, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
felt, perhaps, a little impatient, put on my hat and
left abruptly&mdash;the fair secretary, of whom I shall
evermore stand in supreme awe, scowling at me when
I did so. As I passed into Gower Street&mdash;sweet,
serene Gower Street, sacred from the wheels of profane
cabmen, I was almost surprised to see the
"materialized" forms around me; and it really was
not until I got well within sound&mdash;and smell&mdash;of the
Underground Railway that I quite realized my abased
position, or got out of the spheres whither the lofty
periods of Mrs. Tappan's paper, so mellifluously delivered,
had wafted me!</p>

<h3>AN EVENING'S DIABLERIE.</h3>


<p>Mr. Spurgeon a short time since oracularly placed
it on record that, having hitherto deemed Spiritualism
humbug, he now believes it to be the devil.
This sudden conversion is, of course, final; and
I proceed to narrate a somewhat exceptional endorsement
of the opinion which has recently occurred
within my own experience. There was a time, how
long ago it boots not to say, when <i>I</i> considered Spiritualism
humbug; and a good deal came in my way
which might have led me to the same conclusion as
Mr. Spurgeon, if I had been disposed&mdash;which I am
not&mdash;to go with a hop, skip, and jump.</p>

<p>The investigator who first presented the "diabolical"
theory to my notice was a French Roman
Catholic priest, who had broken discipline so far as to
enter the married state, but retained all the doctrines
of his former faith intact. He had, in fact, anticipated
to some extent the position of P&egrave;re Hyacinthe;
for it was several years ago I first became acquainted
with him. Individually as well as nationally this
gentleman, too, was prone to jump at conclusions.
He lost a dear friend, and immediately proceeded to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
communicate with the departed by means of table-turning
and rapping. For a few days he was quite
convinced of the identity of the communicating spirit;
but then, and all within the compass of a single week,
he pronounced the exorcism of the Catholic Church
on the intelligence, I suppose experimentally in the
first instance; found his challenge not satisfactorily
answered, and immediately jumped to the conclusion
that it was the foul fiend himself. I sat very frequently
with this gentleman afterwards, prior to the
experience I am about to narrate; and certainly the
intelligence always gave itself out to be the spirit unmentionable
to ears polite, whose presence my friend
had taken for granted.</p>

<p>I once went with this gentleman to the Marshalls,
when they were at their zenith. We arranged previously
that he should not sit at the table, but on
one side, and give me a secret signal when he was
silently pronouncing the exorcism. He did so; and
certainly all manifestations at once ceased, though we
had been in full converse with the invisibles a moment
before. Old Mrs. M. had to announce with much
chagrin, "The sperrits is gone!"</p>

<p>My other partner in diablerie was a barrister whom
I must not mention by name, but who possessed
considerable power as a writing medium. The presiding
intelligence in his case was, however, of a
low character, and given to very bad language. He
avowed himself to have been a bargee in the earth-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>plane&mdash;should
one say the water-plane?&mdash;and certainly
swore like one.</p>

<p>As for myself, I am destitute of all "medium-power,"
whatever that may be, though enthusiastic
spirituelle ladies tell me I am "mediumistic"&mdash;a
qualification which is still more occult to me. I own
to being greatly interested in spiritualistic inquiries,
except as regards dark s&eacute;ances, which have a tendency
to send me to sleep; and I believe that my
presence does not "stop manifestations:" so that I
suppose I am not a hopeless sceptic.</p>

<p>On the occasion of which I am about to speak we
met in my study, where I am in the habit of rearing
a few pet snakes. I had just got a fine new specimen;
and having no proper habitation for it, had turned
my waste-basket upside-down on a small chess table,
and left him to tabernacle under it for the night.
This was the table we generally used for s&eacute;ances; and
my legal friend, who was writing, immediately began
to use most foul language, on the subject of the
snake, exhorting me to "put him anywhere, put him
in the cupboard, old boy." Such was the edifying
style of communication we always got through this
worthy limb of the law, but it was so much worse
than usual on the present occasion as to fairly make
us roar at its insane abuse. The gentleman himself,
I ought to add, is by no means prone to profane
swearing. My priestly friend was making a wide-awake
hat reply by tilts; and still got his old reply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
that his Satanic Majesty was personally present. I
did not in the least credit this assertion, any more
than I accepted as proven the identity of the bargee,
though I hold the impersonation in either case to be
a strange psychological fact. That I did not do so
is best evidenced by the circumstance that I said,
"This spirit asserts himself to be his Satanic Majesty.
Have you either of you any objection to communicate
with him supposing such to be the case?"</p>

<p>Neither one nor the other had the slightest. My
Catholic friend, I knew, always carried a bottle of
holy water in his pocket, and at my entreaty forbore
for the moment to exorcise. The legal gentleman,
though a "writer" himself, was not at all convinced
about the phenomena, as was perhaps natural, seeing
the exceedingly bad company to which it professed to
relegate him. As for me, my scepticism was to me
robur et &aelig;s triplex. I disposed of the snake, put out
the gas; and down we three sat, amid profound darkness,
like three male witches in "Macbeth," having
previously locked the door to prevent any one disturbing
our hocus-pocus.</p>

<p>Any one who has sat at an ordinary dark s&eacute;ance
will recollect the number of false starts the table
makes, the exclamations, "Was that a rap?" when
the wood simply cracks, or, "Did you feel a cold
air?" when somebody breathes a little more heavily
than usual. I have myself made the experiment,
though not without adding an open confession im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>mediately
afterwards. I have blown on the fingers
of the sitters, and made them feel sure it was a
"spirit aura," have done the neatest of raps with my
index-finger when my little finger has been securely
hooked in that of my next neighbour. In fact, for
test purposes, dark s&eacute;ances are a mistake, though they
are admirable for a flirtation.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, we were very much
in earnest, and there was no waiting&mdash;I hope
no collusion. I am quite sure I did not myself consciously
produce any manifestation. I can answer for
my legal friend, as far as any one person can answer
for another; and we neither of us suspected&mdash;or suspect&mdash;the
priest of the order of St. Benedict; only we
would rather he had not pronounced such decided
opinions; because the wish might have been father to
the thought, or rather the thought might, in some
utterly unaccountable way, have produced the effects
that followed. I have an idea that if Mr. Spurgeon
in his present frame of mind were to sit at a table for
manifestations, he would obtain the clearest assurance
that it was "all the devil," just as it is well known
Roman Catholic sitters get communications from
Roman Catholic spirits, theists from theistic, and
Mormons from the denizens of some spiritualistic
Utah.</p>

<p>We had not, on this occasion, a moment to wait.
The table forthwith began to plunge and career about
the room as though the bargee&mdash;or the other personage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
himself&mdash;had actually been "in possession." It required
all our agility to follow it in its rapid motion about
the room. At last it became comparatively quiet;
and I received in reply to a question as to who was
present the exceedingly objectionable name which Mr.
Spurgeon has coupled with the whole subject. Some
persons I know entertain a certain amount of respect,
or at all events awe, for the intelligence in question.
For myself I feel nothing of the kind, and therefore I
added, "If you are what you profess to be, give us
some proof." We were sitting with only the tips of
our fingers on the table; but it forthwith rose up
quite perpendicularly, and came down with a crash
that completely shivered it in pieces. I have not the
slightest idea how it was done&mdash;but it certainly was
done. A large portion of the table was reduced to a
condition that fitted it for Messrs. Bryant and May's
manufactory. When we lighted the gas and looked
at our watches we found we had only been sitting a
very few minutes.</p>

<p>Of course the obvious explanation will be that the
gentleman with the diabolical theory and the evidently
strong will-power (as evidenced in the d&eacute;nouement at
Mrs. Marshall's) produced the diabolical effects consciously
or unconsciously. I do not think the former
was the case; and if it is possible to get such results
unconsciously, that phenomenon is quite as curious as
the spiritualistic explanation. In fact I am not sure
that the psychological is not more difficult than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
pneumatological theory. My own notion is that the
"Psychic Force" people are clearly on the right
track, though their cause, as at present elaborated, is
not yet equal to cover all the effects.</p>

<p>Mr. Spurgeon and the "diabolists" concede the
whole of the spiritualistic position. They not only
say that the effects are due to spiritual causes, but
they also identify the producing spirit. I have never
been able to get as far as that. I did not feel on the
occasion in question at all as though I had been in
communication with his sable Majesty. If I was, certainly
my respect for that potentate is not increased,
for I should have fancied he would have done something
much "bigger" in reply to my challenge than
smash up a small chess-table. However, there was a
sort of uncanny feeling about the experience, and it
seemed to me so far illustrative of Mr. Spurgeon's
position as to be worth committing to paper. If that
gentleman, however, lends such a doctrine the sanction
of his approval, he will, let him be assured, do more
to confirm the claims of Spiritualism than all the
sneers of Professors Huxley and Tyndall, and the
scorn of Mr. George Henry Lewes can undo.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUAL ATHLETES.</h3>


<p>I am about for once to depart from my usual custom
of narrating only personal experiences, and in this
and the two following chapters print the communications
of a friend who shares my interest in these
matters, and has frequently accompanied me in my
investigations into this mysterious Borderland. In
these cases, however, he investigated on his own
account, and I am not responsible for the conclusions
at which he arrives:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Attracted," he says, "by an article in a popular
journal on the subject of 'Spirit Faces,' I determined,
if possible, to 'assist' at a s&eacute;ance. I had not hitherto
taken much interest in spiritualistic matters, because
in the first place, the cui bono question remained persistently
unanswered; and, secondly, because most of
the 'doings' were in the dark; and it appears to me
that, given darkness, there are few things in the way
of conjuring and ventriloquism that could <i>not</i> be done.
Terpsichorean tables and talking hats never had any
particular charm for me, because I could always make
a table dance, or a hat say anything I wanted it to
say. I saw the Davenports, and preferred Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Anderson. I even went to a dark s&eacute;ance at the
Marshalls', and noticed that when Mr. and Mrs.
Marshall had perceptibly partaken of beefsteak and
onions, or some equally fragrant food, for dinner, the
breath which accompanied the spirit-voices was unmistakably
impregnated with onions too; and hence
I drew my own conclusions. I am not saying I know
how Mr. and Mrs. Marshall do John King and Katie
King. I don't know how Professor Anderson or
Professor Pepper do their tricks. I confess Mr. Home
and the Marshalls have the pull of the professors in
one way&mdash;that is, they don't perform on a platform
but in a private room, and they let you examine
everything beforehand. Theirs is the ars celare artem.
Again, I don't know how men in the street get out
of the very curious knots in which I have tied them,
but I know they do it; and therefore I am sure the
Davenports could do it without calling in the ghost
of one's deceased grandmamma as a sort of Deus&mdash;or
rather Dea&mdash;ex machin&acirc;. I have never seen Mr.
Home handle fire or elongate. I have seen him
'levitate,' or float, and I candidly confess I don't
know how he does it, any more than I can solve Sir
David Brewster's trick by which four young ladies
can lift a heavy man on the points of their fingers.
It's very mysterious, and very nice for the man.</p>

<p>"So it happened that I had shelved spiritualism for
some time, when the article on 'Spirit Faces' came
under my notice. I did not care so much about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
face part of the matter (at least not the spirit face),
but I wanted to test it as a matter of athletics. In
one respect the physiognomy did interest me, for I
read that the medium was pretty&mdash;mediums, according
to my experience, being generally very much the
reverse&mdash;and I found that report had certainly not
misrepresented the young lady in this respect. Her
name is now public property, so I need not veil it
under the pseudonyms of Miss Blank, or Asterisk, or
anything of that sort. Miss Florence Cook, then, is
a trim little lady of sweet sixteen, and dwells beneath
the parental roof in an eastern suburb of London. It
is quite true she does not accept payment for s&eacute;ances,
which I strove to impress upon her was very foolish
indeed, for she works almost as hard as Lulu twice in
the week. However, she, or rather her parents, take
high ground in the matter, which of course is very
praiseworthy on their parts, and convenient for their
guests if they happen to be impecunious.</p>

<p>"Now, I do not purpose going through the details
of the s&eacute;ance, which was considerably irksome, being
protracted by endless psalm singing. What I want
to do&mdash;with Miss Cook's permission&mdash;is to calculate
the chances of her being sufficiently athletic to perform
the tricks herself, without the aid of spirits.
Does she not underrate her unaided powers in assigning
a supernatural cause for the effects produced?</p>

<p>"Well, then, this lithe little lady is arrayed in the
ordinary garb of the nineteenth century with what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
is technically termed a 'pannier,' and large open
sleeves, each of which, I fear, she must have found
considerably in the way, as also the sundry lockets
and other nick-nacks suspended from her neck.
However, there they were. We put her in a cupboard,
which had a single Windsor chair in it, and
laid a stoutish new cord on her lap. Then came
singing, which may or may not have been intended
to drown any noise in the cupboard; but, after some
delay, she was found tied around the waist, neck, and
two wrists, and the ends of the cord fastened to the
back of the chair. These knots we sealed, and consigned
her to the cupboard again. Shortly after there
appeared at an aperture in the upper portion of the
cupboard a face which looked utterly unspiritual and
precisely like that of the medium, only with some
white drapery thrown over the head. The aperture
was just the height that would have allowed Miss
Cook to stand on the chair and peep out. I do not
say she did; I am only calculating the height. The
face remained some minutes in a strong light; then
descended. We opened the cupboard, and found the
little lady tied as before with the seals unbroken.
Spiritual, or material, it was clever.</p>

<p>"After a pause, the same process was gone through
again; only this time stout tape was substituted for
rope. The cord cut the girl's wrists; and tape was
almost more satisfactory. Again she was bound, and
we sealed the knots; and again a face appeared&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
time quite black, and not like the medium at all. I
noticed that the drapery ran right round the face, and
cut it off at a straight line on the lower part. This
gave the idea of a mask. I am not saying it was a
mask. I am only throwing out a hint that, if the
'spirits' wish to convince people they should let the
neck be well seen. I am bound to say it bore a
strong light for several minutes; and some people
say they saw eyelids. I did not. I do not say they
were not there. I know how impossible it is to prove
a negative, and only say I did not see them.</p>

<p>"What followed possessed no special interest for
any but the professed spiritualist, as it was done without
any tying; Miss Cook arguing logically enough
that, if the previous manifestations were clearly
proved to have taken place by other agency than
that of the medium herself, mere multiplication of
proofs was unnecessary. I had only gone to study
the matter from an athletic point of view; and I
certainly came away impressed with the idea that, if
Miss Florence Cook first got into and then got out of
those knots, she was even more nimble and lithesome
than she looked, and ought to start an Amateur
Ladies' Athletic Society forthwith. As to her making
faces at us through the window, I did not care sufficiently
about the matter to inquire whether she did
or not, because, if she got out of the ropes, it was
easy enough to get on the chair and make faces.</p>

<p>"Of course the cui bono remains. The professors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
make money by it; and Miss Cook can make at most,
only a little mild and scarcely enviable notoriety. A
satirical old friend of mine, when I told him the
above facts, chuckled, and said, 'That's quite enough
for a girl of sixteen; and anything that's do-able, a
girl of those years will do.' It was no use talking to
him of panniers and loose sleeves, and lockets. He
was an old bachelor, and knew nothing about such
things. At least, he had no business to, if he did.</p>

<p>"I cannot forbear adding a domestic episode, though
it is perhaps scarcely relevant to the subject. Certain
young imps in my house, hearing what I had seen,
got up an exhibition of spirit faces for my benefit.
They rigged up a kind of Punch-and-Judy erection,
and the cleanest of them did the spirit face, with a
white pocket-handkerchief over his head. He looked
as stolid and unwinking as the genuine spirit-physiognomy
itself. The gas was lowered to a 'dim
religious light,' and then a black coal-scuttle, with
features chalked on it, deceived some of the circle into
the idea that it was a nigger. But the one element
which interested me was wanting; there was no
rope-tying which could at all entitle the juvenile
performance to be categorized under 'Spiritual
Athletics.'"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<h3>"SPOTTING" SPIRIT MEDIUMS.</h3>


<p>"Among the recent utterances of spiritualistic
organs is one to the effect that 'manifestations' come
in cycles&mdash;in 'great waves,' I believe was the actual
expression; and of the many fluctuations to which
spiritualistic society has been exposed of late is a very
prominent irruption of young lady mediums. The
time seems to have gone by for portly matrons to be
wafted a&euml;rially from the northern suburbs to the W.C.
district, or elderly spinsters to exhibit spirit drawings
which gave one the idea of a water-colour palette
having been overturned, and the resulting 'mess' sat
upon for the purposes of concealment. Even inspirational
speakers have so far 'gone out' as to subside
from aristocratic halls to decidedly second-rate institutions
down back streets. In fact, the 'wave' that
has come over the spirit world seems to resemble that
which has also supervened upon the purely mundane
arrangements of Messrs. Spiers and Pond; and we
anxious investigators can scarcely complain of the
change which brings us face to face with fair young
maidens in their teens to the exclusion of the matrons
and spinsters aforesaid, or the male medium who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
once irreverently termed by a narrator a 'bull-necked
young man.'</p>

<p>"The names of these interesting young denizens of
two worlds are so well known that it is perhaps unnecessary
caution or superfluous gallantry to conceal
them; but I will err, if error it be, on the safe side,
and call No. 1 Miss C. and No. 2 Miss S., premising
only that each is decidedly attractive, with the unquestioned
advantage of having seen only some sixteen
or seventeen summers apiece. Miss C. has been
'out' some time; her familiar being 'Katie King;'
while Miss S. has made her debut more recently,
having for her attendant sprites one 'Florence
Maple,' a young lady spirit who has given a wrong
terrestrial address in Aberdeen, and Peter, a defunct
market gardener, who sings through the young lady's
organism in a clear baritone voice. It was to me
personally a source of great satisfaction when I learnt
that Miss C. had been taken in hand by a F.R.S.&mdash;whom
I will call henceforth the Professor&mdash;and Miss
S. by a Serjeant learned in the law. Now, if ever, I
thought, we have a chance of hearing what science
and evidential acumen have to say on the subject of
'Face Manifestations.' Each of these gentlemen, I
ought to mention, had written voluminously on the
subject of Spiritualism, and both seemed inclined to
contest its claims in favour of some occult physical&mdash;or,
as they named it, psychic&mdash;force. This would
make their verdict the more valuable to outsiders, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
it was clear they had not approached the subject with
a foregone conclusion in its favour. True, the Spiritualists
claimed both the Professor and the Serjeant
persistently as their own; but Spiritualists have a
way of thinking everybody 'converted' who simply
sits still in a decorous manner, and keeps his eyes
open without loudly proclaiming scepticism.</p>

<p>"Personally I had been, up to the date of present
occurrences, accustomed to summarize my convictions
on the subject by the conveniently elastic formula
that there might be 'something in it.' I still think
so; but perhaps with a difference.</p>

<p>"For the former of the two expos&eacute;s&mdash;if such they
shall be deemed&mdash;I am compelled to rely on documentary
evidence; but I have 'sat' so many times
with Miss S., have been requested so often by the
inspirational Peter to 'listen to the whip-poor-will,
a-singin' on the tree,' have shaken the spirit hand,
gazed on the spirit face, and even cut off portions of
the spirit veil of the fair Florence, that I can follow
the order of events just as though I had been present.
I must confess the wonderful similarity existing between
Miss S. and Florence had exercised me considerably,
and perhaps prepared me to accept with
calmness what followed. Why delay the result?
Miss S. and her mamma were invited to the country
house of the learned Serjeant. A 'cabinet' was extemporized
in the bay of the window, over which the
curtains were drawn and a shawl pinned. With a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
confidence which is really charming to contemplate,
no 'tests' were asked of the medium, no 'conditions'
imposed on the sitter. Miss S. was put in the cabinet
with only a chair, and the expectant circle waited
with patience. In due time the curtains were drawn
aside, and the spirit-face appeared at the opening. It
was still the facsimile of Miss S., with the eyes piously
turned up and a ghostly head-dress covering the hair.
One by one the assembled were summoned to look
more closely. The initiated gazed and passed on,
knowing they must not peep; but, alas, one lady who
was <i>not</i> initiated, and therefore unaware of the tacitly
imposed conditions, imitated the example of Mother
Eve, drew aside the curtains and exposed the unspiritual
form of Miss S. standing on the chair; the
'spirit-hands' at the same time struggling so convulsively
to close the aperture that the head-gear fell off,
and betrayed the somewhat voluminous chignon of
Miss S. herself. Hereupon ensued a row, it being
declared that the medium was killed, though eventually
order was restored by the rather incongruous
process of a gentleman present singing a comic
song. The learned Serjeant still clings to the belief
that Miss S. was in a condition of 'unconscious
somnambulism.' I only hope, if ever I am arraigned
before him in his judicial capacity, he will extend his
benevolent credulity to me in an equal degree, and
give me the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>"It may be in the recollection of those who follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the fluctuations of the Spiritual 'wave' that some
months ago a Dialectical gentleman seized rudely on
the spirit form of Katie, which struggled violently
with him, scratching his face and pulling out his
whiskers, eventually making good its retreat into the
cupboard, where Miss C. was presumably bound hand
and foot. I must confess the fact of that escape
rather prejudiced me in favour of Katie, though I
would rather she had evaporated into thin air, and
left the dialectical whiskers intact. Still it scored a
point on Katie's side, and I eagerly availed myself of
the opportunity to pay my devoirs at the shrine of
Miss C.; the more so as the Professor had asserted
twice that he had seen and handled the form of the
medium while looking on and conversing with that of
the spirit at the same time. If I could retain my
former faith in the Professor, of course this would be
final and my conversion an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>"We sat no longer in the subterranean breakfast
room of Miss C.'s parental abode; but moved up to
the parlour floor, where two rooms communicated
through folding doors, the front apartment being that
in which we assembled, and the back used as a bedroom,
where the ladies took off their 'things.' This
latter room, be it remembered, had a second room
communicating with the passage, and so with the
universe of space in general. One leaf of the folding
doors was closed, and a curtain hung over the other.
Pillows were placed on the floor, just inside the cur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>tain,
and the little medium, who was nattily arrayed
in a blue dress, was laid upon them. We were requested
to sing and talk during 'materialization,'
and there was as much putting up and lowering of
the light as in a modern sensation drama. The Professor
acted all the time as Master of the Ceremonies,
retaining his place at the aperture; and I fear, from
the very first, exciting suspicion by his marked attentions,
not to the medium, but to the ghost. When
it did come it was arrayed according to orthodox
ghost fashion, in loose white garments, and I must
confess with no resemblance to Miss C. We were at
the same time shown the recumbent form of the pillowed
medium, and there certainly was something
blue, which might have been Miss C., or only her
gown going to the wash. By-and-by, however, with
'lights down,' a bottle of phosphorized oil was produced,
and by this weird and uncanny radiance one
or two privileged individuals were led by the 'ghost'
into the back bedroom, and allowed to put their hands
on the entranced form of the medium. I was not of
the 'elect,' but I talked to those who were, and their
opinion was that the 'ghost' was a much stouter,
bigger woman than the medium; and I must confess
that certain unhallowed ideas of the bedroom door
and the adjacent kitchen stairs connected themselves
in my mind with recollections of a brawny servant
girl who used to sit sentry over the cupboard in the
breakfast room. Where was she?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"As a final bonne bouche the spirit made its exit
from the side of the folding door covered by the
curtain, and immediately Miss C. rose up with dishevelled
locks in a way that must have been satisfactory
to anybody who knew nothing of the back door
and the brawny servant, or who had never seen the
late Mr. Charles Kean act in the 'Corsican Brothers'
or the 'Courier of Lyons.'</p>

<p>"I am free to confess the final death-blow to my
belief that there might be 'something in' the Face
Manifestations was given by the effusive Professor
who has 'gone in' for the Double with a pertinacity
altogether opposed to the calm judicial examination
of his brother learned in the law, and with prejudice
scarcely becoming a F.R.S.</p>

<p>"I am quite aware that all this proves nothing.
Miss S. and Miss C. may each justify Longfellow's
adjuration&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Trust her not, she is fooling thee;'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and yet ghosts be as genuine as guano. Only I fancy
the 'wave' of young ladies will have to ebb for a
little while; and I am exceedingly interested in
speculating as to what will be the next 'cycle.'
From 'information I have received,' emanating from
Brighton, I am strongly of opinion that babies are
looking up in the ghost market, and that our next
manifestations may come through an infant phenomenon."</p>

<h3>A S&Eacute;ANCE FOR SCEPTICS.</h3>


<p>"Attracted by the prominence recently given to the
subject of Spiritualism in the <i>Times</i>, and undeterred
by that journal's subsequent recantation, or the inevitable
scorn of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, I determined
to test for myself the value of the testimony so
copiously quoted by believers in the modern marvel.
Clearly if certain published letters of the period were
to be put in evidence, Spiritualism had very much the
better, and Science exceedingly little to say for itself.
But we all know that this is a subject on which
scientific men are apt to be reticent. 'Tacere tutum
est' seems the Fabian policy adopted by those who
find this new Hannibal suddenly come from across
sea into their midst. It is moreover a subject about
which the public will not be convinced by any amount
of writing or talking, but simply by what it can see
and handle for itself. It may be of service, then, if
I put on record the result of an examination made
below the surface of this matter.</p>

<p>"Like most other miracles this particular one evidently
has its phases and comes about in cycles. For
a generation past, or nearly so, Modern Spiritualism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
has been so far allied with Table-turning and mysterious
rappings as to have appropriated to itself in
consequence certain ludicrous titles, against which it
vainly protests. Then cropped up 'levitations' and
'elongations' of the person, and Mr. Home delighted
to put red-hot coals on the heads of his friends.
None of these manifestations, however, were sufficient
to make the spiritualistic theory any other than a
huge petitio principii. The Davenports were the first
to inaugurate on anything like an extended scale the
alleged appearance of the human body, or rather of
certain members of the human body, principally arms
and hands, through the peep-hole of their cabinet.
Then came 'spirit-voices' with Mrs. Marshall, and
a&euml;rial transits on the part of Mrs. Guppy; then the
entire 'form of the departed' was said to be visible
chez Messrs. Herne and Williams in Lamb's Conduit
Street, whose abode formed Mrs. Guppy's terminus
on the occasion of her nocturnal voyage. Then came
Miss Florence Cook's spirit faces at Hackney, which
were produced under a strong light, which submitted
to be touched and tested in what seemed a very complete
manner, and even held conversations with persons
in the circle. Finally, I heard it whispered that these
faces were being recognised on a somewhat extensive
scale at the s&eacute;ances of Mrs. Holmes, in Old Quebec
Street, where certain other marvels were also to be
witnessed, which decided me on paying that lady a
visit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even these, however, were not the principal attractions
which drew me to the tripod of the seeress in
Quebec Street. It had been continually urged as an
argument against the claims of Modern Spiritualism,
first, that it shunned the light and clave to 'dark'
circles; secondly, that it was over-sensitive on the
subject of 'sceptics.' Surely, we are all sceptics in
the sense of investigators. The most pretentious
disciple of Spiritualism does not claim to have exhausted
the subject. On the contrary, they all tell us
we are now only learning the alphabet of the craft.
Perhaps the recognised Spirit-faces may have landed
us in words of one syllable, but scarcely more. However,
the great advantage which Mrs. Holmes possessed
in my eyes over all professors of the new art
was that she did not object to sceptics. Accordingly
to Quebec Street I went, for the distinct purpose of
testing the question of recognition. If I myself, or
any person on whose testimony I could rely, established
a single case of undoubted recognition, that, I
felt, would go farther than anything else towards
solving the spiritualistic problem.</p>

<p>"I devoted two Monday evenings to this business;
that being the day on which Mrs. Holmes,
as she phrases it, 'sits for faces.' On the former of
the two occasions twenty-seven persons assembled,
and the first portion of the evening was devoted to
the Dark S&eacute;ance, which presented some novel features
in itself, but was not the special object for which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
was present. Mrs. Holmes, who is a self-possessed
American lady, evidently equal to tackling any
number of sceptics, was securely tied in a chair.
All the circle joined hands; and certainly, as soon as
the light was out, fiddles, guitars, tambourines and
bells did fly about the room in a very unaccountable
manner, and when the candle was lighted, I found a
fiddle-bow down my back, a guitar on my lap, and a
tambourine ring round my neck. But there was
nothing spiritual in this, and the voice which
addressed us familiarly during the operation may or
may not have been a spirit voice.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holmes having been released from some very
perplexing knots, avowedly by Spirit power, proceeded
to what is called the 'Ring Test,' and I was
honoured by being selected to make the experiment.
I sat in the centre of the room and held both her
hands firmly in mine. I passed my hands over her
arms, without relaxing my grasp, so as to feel that
she had nothing secreted there; when suddenly a
tambourine ring, jinglers and all, was passed on to
my arm. Very remarkable; but still not necessarily
spiritual. Certain clairvoyants present said they
could witness the 'disintegration' of the ring. I
only felt it pass on to my arm. On the occasion
of my second visit this same feat was performed on
an elderly gentleman, a very confirmed sceptic indeed.
This second circle consisted of twenty persons, many
of them very pronounced disbelievers, and not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
little inclined to be 'chaffy.' However all went on
swimmingly.</p>

<p>"After about an hour of rather riotous dark s&eacute;ance,
lights were rekindled and circles re-arranged for the
Face S&eacute;ance which takes place in subdued light. In the
space occupied by the folding doors between the front
and back room a large black screen is placed, with an
aperture, or peep-hole, about eighteen inches square,
cut in it. The most minute examination of this back
room is allowed, and I took care to lock both doors,
leaving the keys crosswise in the key-hole, so that
they could not be opened from the outside. We
then took our seats in the front room in three or four
lines. I myself occupied the centre of the first row,
about four feet from the screen, Mr. and Mrs. Holmes
sitting at a small table in front of the screen; the
theory being that the spirits behind collect from their
'emanations' material to form the faces. Soon
after we were in position a most ghostly-looking
child's face appeared at the aperture, but was not
recognised. Several other corpse-like visages followed
with like absence of recognition. Then came
a very old lady's face, quite life-like, and Mrs. Holmes
informed us that the cadaverous people were those
only recently deceased. The old lady looked
anxiously round as if expecting to be recognised,
but nobody claimed acquaintance. In fact no face
was recognised at my first visit. The next was a
jovial Joe Bagstock kind of face which peered quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
merrily round our circle, and lastly came a most life-like
countenance of an elderly man. This face,
which had a strange leaden look about the eyes, came
so close to the orifice that it actually <i>lifted</i> its grey
beard outside. On the occasion of my second visit a
lady present distinctly recognised this as the face of
her husband, and asked the form to show its hand as
an additional mark of identity. This request was
complied with, the figure lifting a thin, white and&mdash;as
the widow expressed it&mdash;'aristocratic' hand, and kissing
it most politely. I am bound to say there was less
emotion manifested on the part of the lady than I should
have expected under the circumstances; and a young
man who accompanied her, and who from the likeness
to her must have been her son, surveyed his resuscitated
papa calmly through a double-barrelled
opera glass. I am not sure that I am at liberty to
give this lady's name; but, at this second visit, Mrs.
Makdougall Gregory, of 21, Green Street, Grosvenor
Square, positively identified the old lady above-mentioned
as a Scotch lady of title well known to
her.</p>

<p>"I myself was promised that a relation of my own
would appear on a future occasion; but on neither of
those when I attended did I see anything that would
enable me to test the value of the identifications. The
faces, however, were so perfectly life-like, with the
solitary exception of a dull leaden expression in the
eye, that I cannot imagine the possibility of a doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
existing as to whether they belonged to persons one
knew or not. At all events here is the opportunity
of making the test. No amount of scepticism is a
bar to being present. The appearances are not limited
to a privileged few. All see alike: so that the
matter is removed out of the sphere of 'hallucinations.'
Everything is done in the light, too, as far
as the faces are concerned. So that several not
unreasonable test-conditions are fulfilled in this case,
and so far a step made in advance of previous manifestations.</p>

<p>"We may well indeed pause&mdash;at least I know I did&mdash;to
shake ourselves, and ask whereabouts we are.
Is this a gigantic imposture? or are the Witch of
Endor and the Cum&aelig;an Sibyl revived in the unromantic
neighbourhood of the Marble Arch, and under
circumstances that altogether remove them from the
category of the miraculous? England will take a
good deal of convincing on this subject, which is evidently
one that no amount of 'involuntary muscular
action,' or 'unconscious cerebration,' will cover.
What if the good old-fashioned ghost be a reality
after all, and Cock Lane no region of the supernatural?</p>

<p>"What then? Why, one may expect to meet one's
deceased ancestors at any hour of the day or night,
provided only there be a screen for them to 'form'
behind, and a light sufficiently subdued to prevent
disintegration; with, of course, the necessary pigeon-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>hole
for the display of their venerable physiognomies.
On their side of the question, it will be idle to say,
'No rest but the grave!' for there may not be rest
even there, if Delphic priestesses and Cum&aelig;an
Sibyls come into vogue again; and we may as well
omit the letters R. I. P. from our obituary notices as
a purely superfluous form of speech."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Speaking now in my own proper person as author,
I may mention&mdash;as I have purposely deferred doing
up to this point&mdash;that a light was subsequently struck
at one of Mrs. Holmes's Dark S&eacute;ances, and that the
discoveries thus made rendered the s&eacute;ance a final one.
Mr. and Mrs. Holmes retired, first to Brighton, and
then to America.</p>

<p>They were, at the time of my writing, holding
successful s&eacute;ances in the latter place; and public
(Spiritualistic) opinion still clings to the belief that
Mrs. Holmes is a genuine medium.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<h3>AN EVENING WITH THE HIGHER SPIRITS.</h3>


<p>At the head of social heresies, and rapidly beginning
to take rank as a religious heresy as well, I have no
hesitation in placing modern Spiritualism. Those
who associate this latest mystery only with gyrating
articles of furniture, rapping tables, or simpering
planchettes, are simply in the abyss of ignorance,
and dangerously underrate the gravity of the
subject. The later development of Spirit Faces and
Spirit Forms, each of which I have examined thoroughly,
and made the results of my observations
public, fail to afford any adequate idea of the pitch to
which the mania&mdash;if mania it be&mdash;has attained. To
many persons Spiritualism forms the ultimatum, not
only in science, but also in religion. Whatever the
Spirits tell them they believe and do as devoutly as
the Protestant obeys his Bible, the Catholic his
Church, or the scientific man follows up the results of
his demonstrations. That is, in fact, the position
they assume. They claim to have attained in matters
of religion to demonstration as clear and infallible as
the philosopher does in pure science. They say no
longer "We believe," but "We know." These people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
care little for the vagaries of Dark Circles, or even
the doings of young ladies with "doubles." The
flight of Mrs. Guppy through the air, the elongation
of Mr. Home's braces, the insertion of live coals
among the intricacies of Mr. S. C. Hall's exuberant
locks, are but the A B C which have led them to
their present advanced position. These physical
"manifestations" may do for the neophytes. They
are the initiated. I am the initiated; or I ought to
be, if patience and perseverance constitute serving an
apprenticeship. I have devoted a good portion of my
late life to the study. I have given up valuable
evenings through several consecutive winters to dark
s&eacute;ances; have had my hair pulled, my head thumped
with paper tubes, and suffered other indignities at the
hands of the "Invisibles;" and, worse than all, my
friends have looked upon me as a lunatic for my
pains, and if my enemies could have wrought their
will they would have incarcerated me as non compos,
or made an auto-da-fe of me as a heretic years ago.</p>

<p>Through sheer length of service, then, if on no
other account, I had grown somewhat blas&eacute; with the
ordinary run of manifestations. Spirit Faces no
longer interest me; for I seek among them in vain
the lineaments of my departed friends. Spirit Hands
I shake as unconcernedly as I do those of my familiar
acquaintances at the club or in the street. I have
even cut off a portion of the veil of Miss Florence
Maple, the Aberdeen Spirit, and gone away with it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
my pocket: so that it was, at all events, a new sensation
when I received an invitation to be present at a
trance s&eacute;ance, where one of the Higher Spirits communicated
to the assembled things undreamed of in
mundane philosophy. The sitting was a strictly
private one; so I must not mention names or localities;
but this does not matter, as I have no marvels
in the vulgar sense of the word to relate: only
Higher Teachings, which will do just as well with
asterisks or initials as with the names in full.</p>

<p>The scene, then, was an artist's studio at the West
End of London, and the medium a magnetic lady with
whom I had frequently sat before, though not for the
"Higher" teachings. Her instruction had so far
come in the shape of very vigorous raps, which ruined
my knuckles to imitate them, and in levitation of a
small and volatile chess table, which resisted all my
efforts to keep it to the paths of propriety. This lady
was not young; and I confess frankly this was, to my
thinking, an advantage. When I once told a sceptical
friend about Miss Florence Cook's s&eacute;ance, and
added, triumphantly, "Why, she's a pretty little
simple girl of sixteen," that clenched the doubts of
this Thomas at once, for he rejoined, "What is there
that a pretty little <i>simple</i> girl of sixteen won't do?"
Miss Showers is sweet sixteen, too; and when
"Peter" sings through her in a clear baritone voice,
I cannot, despite myself, help the thought occasionally
flitting across my mind, "Would that you were six-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>and-twenty,
or, better still, six-and-thirty, instead of
sixteen!" Without specifying to which of the two
latter classes our present medium belonged, one might
venture to say she had safely passed the former. She
was of that ripe and Rubens-like beauty to which we
could well imagine some "Higher" spirit offering
the golden apple of its approval, however the skittish
Paris of the spheres might incline to sweet sixteen.
I had a short time before sat infructuously with this
lady, when a distressing contretemps occurred. We
were going in for a dark s&eacute;ance then, and just as we
fancied the revenants were about to justify the title,
we were startled by a crash, and on my lighting up,
all of the medium I could see were two ankles protruding
from beneath the table. She had fainted
"right off," as the ladies say, and it required something
strong to bring her to. In fact, we all had a
"refresher," I recollect, for sitting is generally found
to be exhausting to the circle as well as to the
medium. On the present occasion, however, everything
was, if not en plein jour, en plein gaz. There
was a good deal of preliminary difficulty as to the
choice of a chair for the medium. Our artist-friend
had a lot of antique affairs in his studio, no two
being alike, and I was glad to see the lady select a
capacious one with arms to it, from which she would
not be likely to topple off when the spirits took
possession. The rest of us sat in a sort of irregular
circle round the room, myself alone being accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>modated
with a small table, not for the purposes of
turning (I am set down as "too physical") but in
order to report the utterances of the Higher Spirits.
We were five "assistants" in all&mdash;our host, a young
lady residing with him, another lady well known as a
musical artiste, with her mamma and my unworthy
self. Installed in her comfortable chair, the medium
went through a series of facial contortions, most of
which looked the reverse of pleasing, though occasionally
she smiled benignantly par parenth&egrave;se. I was
told&mdash;or I understood it so&mdash;that this represented
her upward passage through different spheres. She
was performing, in fact, a sort of spiritualistic "Excelsior."
By way of assimilating our minds to the
matter in hand, we discussed the Apocryphal Gospels,
which happened to be lying on the table; and very
soon, without any other process than the facial contortions
having been gone through, the medium
broke silence, and, in measured tones of considerable
benignity, said:&mdash;"Friends, we greet you in the
name of our Lord and Master. Let us say the
Lord's Prayer."</p>

<p>She then repeated the Lord's Prayer, with considerable
alterations from the Authorized Version, especially,
I noticed, inserting the Swedenborgian expressions,
"the Heavens," "on earth;" but also altering
the order of the clauses, and omitting one altogether.
She then informed us that she was ready to answer
questions on any subject, but that we were not bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to accept any teaching which she&mdash;or let us say they,
for it was the spirits now speaking&mdash;might give us.
"What did we wish to know?" I always notice
that when this question is asked at a spirit circle
everybody simultaneously shuts up, as though the
desire for knowledge were dried at its source. Nobody
spoke, and I myself was not prepared with a
subject, but I had just been reviewing a Swedenborgian
book, and I softly insinuated "Spiritual
Marriage." It was graciously accepted; and our
Sibyl thus delivered herself:&mdash;Mankind, the higher
Spirit or Spirits, said was originally created in pairs,
and the soul was still dual. Somehow or other&mdash;my
notes are not quite clear how&mdash;the parts had got
mixed up, separated, or wrongly sorted. There were,
however, some advantages in this wrong sorting, which
was so frequent an accident of terrestrial marriage,
since it was possible for people to be too much alike&mdash;an
observation I fancied I had heard before, or at
least not so profound a one as to need a ghost "Come
from the dead to tell us that, Horatio!" When the
right halves did get together on earth the good developed
for good, the evil for evil, until they got to
the heavens or the other places&mdash;they were all plurals.
Swedenborgianism has an objection to the singular
number; and I could not fail to identify the teaching
of the Higher Spirit at once with that of the New
Jerusalem Church. Two preliminary facts were
brought before us; the Higher Spirits were in theo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>logy
Swedenborgian, and in medical practice hom&oelig;opaths.
So was the Medium. Although there was
no marriage in the spiritual world, in our sense of the
term, there was not only this re-sorting and junction
of the disunited bivalves, but there were actual "nuptials"
celebrated. We were to be careful and understand
that what terrestrials called marriage celestials
named nuptials&mdash;it seemed to me rather a distinction
without a difference. There was no need of any
ceremony, but still a ceremony was pleasing and also
significant. I asked if it was true, as I had read in
the Swedenborgian book, that all adult angels were
married. She replied, "Yes; they married from the
age of 18 to 24, and the male was always a few years
older than the female."</p>

<p>There was a tendency, which I continually had to
check, on the part of the Medium to wander off from
matrimonial to theological subjects; and the latter,
though trite, were scarcely so heterodox as I expected.
I had found most "spiritualistic" teaching to be
purely Theistic. Love to God and man were declared
to be the great essentials, and creeds to matter little.
If a man loved truth, it was no matter how wild or
absurd his ideas might be. The love of God might
seem a merely abstract idea, but it was not so. To
love goodness was to love God. The love of the
neighbour, in the sense of loving all one's kind, might
seem hard, too; but it was not really so. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
were in the sphere where this Intelligence dwelt millions
of angels, or good spirits, working for the salvation
of men.</p>

<p>I ought to mention that this lady, in her normal
condition, is singularly reticent, and that the "communications"
I chronicle were delivered fluently in one
unbroken chain of what often rose into real eloquence.</p>

<p>So Christ came for the good of man, and Christ
was not the only Messiah who had appeared on earth.
In the millions of ages that had passed over our
globe, and in the other planets of our solar system,
there had risen up "other men filled with the spirit
of good, and so Sons of God." I here tried to get at
the views of the Higher Spirits on the Divinity of
Christ, but found considerable haziness; at one time
it was roundly asserted, at another it seemed to me
explained away by such expressions as I have quoted
above.</p>

<p>Our planet, I was informed, had been made the
subject of special care because we were more material,
more "solid" than the inhabitants of any other orb.
There was an essential difference between Christ and
all other great teachers, such as Buddha; and there
were no historical records of any other manifestation
of the Messiah than that we possessed; but such
manifestations had taken place.</p>

<p>The Spirit then gave us an account of its surroundings,
which is, I believe, purely Swedenborgian. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
"celestial" angels were devoted to truth, the "spiritual"
angels to goodness; and so, too, there were
the Homes of the Satans, where falsehoods prevailed,
and of the Devils, where evils predominated. Spirits
from each of these came to man and held him in
equilibrio; but gained power as his will inclined towards
them. The will was not altogether free, because
affected by inherited tendencies; but the "determination"
was. I have no idea what the Higher Spirit
meant by this; and I rather fancy the Higher Spirit
was in some doubt itself. It rather put me in mind
of the definition of metaphysics: "If you are talking
to me of what you know nothing about, and I don't
understand a word of what you are saying&mdash;that's
metaphysics."</p>

<p>All can do good, continued the Sibyl. Evil cannot
compel you. Utter only such an aspiration as, "God
help me," and it brings a crowd of angels round you.
From those who came to them from this world, however,
they (the Higher Spirits) found that teachers
taught more about what we were to think than what
we were to do. Goodness was so easy. A right
belief made us happier; but right action was essential.</p>

<p>Pushed by our host, who was rather inclined to
"badger" the Higher Spirit, as to irresistible tendencies,
the Intelligence said they were <i>not</i> irresistible.
When we arrived in the Spirit World we should find
everything that had occurred in our lives photographed.
You will condemn yourselves, it was added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
You will not be "had up" before an angry God.
<i>You</i> will decide, in reference to any wrong action,
whether you could help it. Even in the act of doing
it a man condemns himself; much more so there.
The doctrine of the Atonement was summarily disposed
of as a "damnable heresy." "Does the Great
Spirit want one man to die? It hurts us even to
think of it!"</p>

<p>I then questioned the Medium with regard to the
resurrection of the body; and was told that man, as
originally created, was a spiritual being, but had
"superinduced" his present body of flesh&mdash;how he
managed it I did not quite gather. As to possible
sublimation of corporeal integument, the case of
ghosts was mentioned. It was to no purpose I gently
insinuated I had never seen a ghost, or had the existence
of one properly authenticated. I was told
that if I fired a pistol through a ghost only a small
particle of dust would remain which could be swept
up. I was not aware that even so much would
remain. Fancy "sweeping up" a Higher Spirit!</p>

<p>I could not help once or twice pausing to look
round on this strange preacher and congregation.
The comfortable-looking lady propped in an arm-chair,
and with an urbane smile discoursing on these
tremendous topics, our little congregation of five,
myself writing away for dear life, the young hostess
nursing a weird-looking black cat; the other young
lady continually harking back to "conjugal" sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>jects,
which seemed to interest her; the mamma
slightly flabbergastered at the rather revolutionary
nature of the communications; and our host every
now and then throwing in a rude or caustic remark.
I dreaded to think what might have been the result
of a domiciliary visit paid by a Commissioner in
Lunacy to that particular studio!</p>

<p>Back, then, the musical young lady took us to
conjugal pairs. It was very difficult to convey to us
what this conjugal love was like. Was it Elective
Affinity? I asked. Yes; something like that, but
still not that. It was the spontaneous gravitation in
the spheres, either to other, of the halves of the dual
spirit dissociated on earth. Not at all&mdash;again in
reply to me&mdash;like flirting in a corner. The two,
when walking in the spheres, looked like one. This
conjugal puzzle was too much for us. We "gave it
up;" and with an eloquent peroration on the Dynamics
of Prayer, the s&eacute;ance concluded.</p>

<p>The Lord's Prayer was again said, with even more
varieties than before; a few extemporaneous supplications
were added. The process of coming-to seemed
even more disagreeable, if one may judge by facial
expression, than going into the trance. Eventually,
to get back quite to earth, our Sibyl had to be demesmerized
by our host, and in a few minutes was partaking
of a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee as
though she had never been in nubibus at all.</p>

<p>What the psychological condition had been I leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
for those more learned than myself to determine.
That some exaltation of the faculties took place was
clear. That the resulting intelligence was of deep
practical import few, I fancy, would aver. Happily
my mission is not to discuss, but to describe; and so
I simply set down my experience in the same terms
in which it was conveyed to me as "An Evening
with the Higher Spirits."</p>

<h3>SPIRIT FORMS.</h3>


<p>Some years ago I contributed to the columns of a
daily paper an article on Spirit Faces, which was to
me the source of troubles manifold. In the first place,
the inquirers into Spiritualism, whose name I found
to be legion, inundated me with letters, asking me to
take them to the house of pretty Miss Blank, the
medium. Miss Blank might have been going on till
now, holding nightly receptions, without having exhausted
her list of self-invited guests; I had but one
answer; the lady was a comparative stranger to me,
and not a professional medium; ergo, the legion must
ask some one to chaperone them elsewhere. Spirit
Faces had got comparatively common and almost
gone out since I wrote. We are a long way beyond
faces now. Then, again, my second source of trouble
was that forthwith, from the date of my writing, the
Spiritualists claimed me for their own, as Melancholy
did the young gentleman in Gray's elegy. Though I
fancied my paper was only a calm judicial statement
of things seen, and I carefully avoided saying whether
I was convinced or not, I found myself nolens volens
enrolled among the initiated, and expected to devote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
about five evenings out of the seven to s&eacute;ances. I
did go, and do go still to a great many; so that I feel
pretty well posted up in the "Latest Intelligence" of
the Spiritual world. But the worst of all is that my
own familiar friends, in whom I trusted, have also
lifted up their heels against me&mdash;I mean metaphorically,
of course. "What's the last new thing in
spirits?" they ask me out loud in omnibuses or railway
carriages, causing my fellow-travellers to look at
me in doubt as to whether I am a licensed victualler
or a necromancer. As "bigots feign belief till they
believe," I really begin to have some doubts myself
as to the state of my convictions.</p>

<p>But I wish to make this paper again a simple statement
of things heard and seen&mdash;especially seen. I
flatter myself the title is a nice, weird, ghostly one,
calculated to make people feel uncomfortable about
the small hours of the morning. Should such be the
case&mdash;as they say in prefaces&mdash;the utmost hopes of
the writer will be realized. When last I communicated
my experiences, the ultimate end we had reached
was the appearance of a white counterpart of pretty
Miss Blank's face at the peep-hole of a corner cupboard.
There were a good many more or less&mdash;generally
less&mdash;successful imitations of this performance
in various quarters, and the sensation subsided.
Miss B. was still facile princeps from the fact that
she stood full light&mdash;I mean her spirit-face did&mdash;whilst
all the others leaned to a more or less dim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
religious kind of gloom. In a short time, however,
"Katie"&mdash;as the familiar of Miss B. was termed&mdash;thought
she would be able to "materialize" herself so
far as to present the whole form, if we re-arranged
the corner cupboard so as to admit of her doing so.
Accordingly we opened the door, and from it suspended
a rug or two opening in the centre, after the
fashion of a Bedouin Arab's tent, formed a semicircle,
sat and sang Longfellow's "Footsteps of Angels."
Therein occurs the passage: "Then the forms of the
departed enter at the open door." And, lo and behold,
though we had left Miss B. tied and sealed to her
chair, and clad in an ordinary black dress somewhat
voluminous as to the skirts, a tall female figure draped
classically in white, with bare arms and feet, did enter
at the open door, or rather down the centre from
between the two rugs, and stood statue-like before
us, spoke a few words, and retired; after which we
entered the Bedouin tent and found pretty Miss B.
with her dress as before, knots and seals secure, and
her boots on! This was Form No. 1, the first I had
ever seen. It looked as material as myself; and on a
subsequent occasion&mdash;for I have seen it several times&mdash;we
took four very good photographic portraits of it
by magnesium light. The difficulty I still felt, with
the form as with the faces, was that it seemed so
thoroughly material and flesh-and-blood like. Perhaps,
I thought, the authoress of "The Gates Ajar" is right,
and the next condition of things may be more material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
than we generally think, even to the extent of admitting,
as she says, pianofortes among its adjuncts. But
I was to see something much more ghostly than this.</p>

<p>The great fact I notice about Spiritualism is, that
it is obeying the occult impetus of all great movements,
and steadily going from east to west. From
Hackney and Highbury it gravitates towards Belgravia
and Tyburnia. I left the wilds of Hackney
behind, and neared Hyde Park for my next Form. I
must again conceal names and localities; I have no
desire to advertise mediums, or right to betray persons
who have shown me hospitality&mdash;and Spirit Forms.
We arranged ourselves in a semicircle around the
curtains which separated the small back drawing-room
from the large front one, joined hands, sang until we
were hoarse as crows, and kept our eyes steadily fixed
on an aperture left between the curtains for the faces
to show themselves. The room was in blank darkness,
and, feeling rather tired of the incantation, I
looked over my shoulder into the gloom, and lo! a
shadowy form stood self-illuminated not far from me.
At last I had seen it&mdash;a good orthodox ghost in white,
and visible in the darkness. It was the form of the
redoubtable John King himself, who was, I believe, a
bold buccaneer in the flesh, but who looked more like
an Arab sheikh in the spirit. He sailed about the
room, talked to us, and finally disappeared. Eventually
he reappeared behind the curtains, and for a brief
space the porti&egrave;re was drawn aside, and the spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
form was seen lighting up the recumbent figure of
the medium, who was stretched on a sofa, apparently
in deep trance. It must be borne in mind that we
were forming a cordon round the passage from one
room to the other during the whole of this time. A
trio of "spirits" generally puts in an appearance at
these s&eacute;ances. In this case there were John King,
whom I had now seen, as well as heard; Katie, the
familiar of Miss B.; and a peculiarly lugubrious gentleman
named Peter, who, I fancy, has not been
seen, but who has several times done me the favour
of grasping my hand and hoisting me towards the
ceiling, as though he were going to carry me off bodily
to spirit-land. I stand some six feet in my boots, and
have stepped upon my chair, and still felt the hand
coming downwards to me&mdash;where from I have no idea.</p>

<p>But my later experiences have still to be told. I
was invited a few weeks ago to a very select s&eacute;ance
indeed, where the same medium was to officiate. This
family, who spared no expense in their investigations,
had actually got a large, handsome cabinet standing
in their dining-room as a recognised piece of furniture.
It was only used, however, on this occasion for the
imprisonment of the medium. The evolutions of John
King, who soon appeared, all took place outside the
cabinet door. He was only "materialized" to the
middle; and, to our utter amazement, came up to the
table, and apparently <i>through</i> the table, into the very
middle of the circle, where he disported himself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
various ways, keeping up an animated conversation
the whole time, and frequently throwing himself into
the attitude of a person swimming on his back. He
also went upwards as high as the gasalier, and altogether
did a good many marvellous things, considering
that all this time he presented the appearance of
only half a man illuminated by his own light.</p>

<p>On one occasion only have I been seated next to
the medium during the manifestation of any of these
forms. At this s&eacute;ance I held him firmly by one
hand, and a slightly sceptical lady had the other.
We never let go for a moment, but during the whole
of the sitting, while John King, Katie, and Peter
were talking, tiny children's hands were playing with
my arm, hands, and hair. There were, of course, no
children in the room. Peter, the lugubrious, is great
at light porterage. I have known him bring a large
collection of valuable S&egrave;vres china, and a timepiece
with its glass case, from the chimney-piece to the
table&mdash;no easy task in the light, much less in blank
darkness. He also frequently takes down the pictures
from the wall and puts them on the table.
Katie winds up a large musical box, and wafts it,
while playing, all over the room. Of course we rub
our eyes and ask what on earth, if it be on earth,
does this mean? I have not&mdash;to keep up the diction
of my subject&mdash;the <i>ghost</i> of an idea. If it's conjuring,
why don't the mediums say so, and enter the
field openly against Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and Dr. Lynn? Even if I had a decided opinion
about it I should refrain from propounding it here,
because, in the first place, it would be an impertinence,
and, in the second, no conclusion can be arrived at
upon testimony alone. People must see for themselves
and draw their own inferences. In the meantime
the thing, whatever it is, grows and grows
upwards. A year ago I had to journey down east to
find it. Now I must array myself gorgeously like a
Staffordshire miner, and seek the salons of the West.
The great desideratum, it still appears to me, is that
some man with a name in science should examine the
matter, honestly resolving to endorse the facts if true,
but to expose them mercilessly if there be a loophole
for suspicion. Omne ignotum pro magnifico habetur.
I used to think ghosts big things, but that was
before I knew them. I should think no more of
meeting a ghost now than a donkey on a dark night,
and would infinitely sooner tackle a spirit than a
burglar. People's curiosity is roused, and the sooner
somebody gets at the truth the better. It is a somewhat
irksome task, it is true; but no general principle
can be arrived at except by an induction of particulars.
Let us be Baconian, even to our ghosts.
If they <i>are</i> ghosts, they are a good deal more substantial
than I had thought. If they are not, let
somebody, in the name of nineteenth-century
science, send them off as with the crow of chanticleer,
and let us hear no more of Spirit Faces or Spirit Forms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<h3>SITTING WITH A SIBYL.</h3>


<p>The connexion of modesty with merit is proverbial,
though questioned by Sydney Smith, who says
their only point in common is the fact that each
begins with an&mdash;m. Modesty, however&mdash;waiving
the question of accompanying merit&mdash;is a trait which,
in my mystic inquiries and devious wanderings, I
meet with far more frequently than might be expected.
I have just met with two instances which I
hasten to put on record, if only to confute those who
say that the age in general, and spirit mediums in
particular, are not prone to be modest and retiring.
My first modest person was a Spirit Photographer;
my second was a Sibyl. I might have looked for
bashfulness in the latter, but was certainly surprised
to meet with it in the former. I suddenly learnt
from the Medium the fact that a Spirit Photographer
had settled down in my immediate neighbourhood,
and the appearance of his ghostly advertisement
brings to my recollection some previous mystic experiences
I myself had in this way.</p>

<p>A now celebrated medium, Mrs. Guppy, n&eacute;e Miss
Nicholl, was, in the days of her maidenhood, a prac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>titioner
of photography in Westbourne Grove; and,
as far as I know, she might have been the means of
opening up to the denizens of the Summer Land this
new method of terrestrial operations. Ever on the
qui vive for anything new in the occult line, I at once
interviewed Miss Nicholl and sat for my portrait, expecting
at the least to find the attendant spirit of my
departed grandmamma or defunct maiden aunt standing
sentinel over me, as I saw departed relations
doing in many cartes de visite in the room. I confess
there was a kind of made-up theatrical-property
look about the attendant spirits which gave one the
idea that the superior intelligences must have dressed
in a hurry when they sat or stood for their portraits.
They looked, in fact, if it be not irreverent to say it,
rather like so many bundles of pneumatical rags than
respectable domestic ghosts. However, as long as I
got the ghosts I did not care about the dress. Tenue
de soir point de rigueur, I would have said, as they do
outside the cheap casinos in Paris, or "Evening dress
not required," if one must descend to the vernacular.
Well, I sat persistently and patiently through I am
afraid to say how many operations, and the operator
described me as being surrounded by spirits&mdash;I always
am according to Mediums, but my spirits must be
eminently unsociable ones, for they seldom give me a
word, and on this occasion refused to be "taken" as
resolutely as the bashful gentleman in the <i>Graphic</i>
who resisted the operations of the prison officials to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
obtain a sun-picture of his interesting physiognomy.
There was indeed a blotch on one of the negatives,
which I was assured was a spirit. I could not see
things in that light.</p>

<p>Foiled on this particular occasion my anxiety was
dormant, but never died out. I still longed for a
denizen of the other world to put in an appearance,
and kept on being photographed over and over again
until I might have been the vainest man alive, on the
bare hope that the artist might be a Medium malgr&eacute;
lui or undeveloped. I had heard there were such
beings, but they never came in my way. I was really
serious in this wish, because I felt if it could be
granted, the possibility of deception being prevented,
the objectivity of the phenomena would be guaranteed.
At this time I was heretical enough to believe that
most ghosts were due to underdone pork or untimely
Welsh rare-bits, and that the raps assigned to their
agency were assignable to the active toes of the
Medium which might be anywhere and up to anything
with the opportunities of a dark s&eacute;ance.</p>

<p>A short time since, however, M. Buguet, a celebrated
French Spirit Photographer came from Paris
to London, and received sitters for the modest sum of
30<i>s.</i> each. This would have been much beyond my
means; but I suppose my wish had transpired, and
that gentleman sent me an invitation to sit gratis,
which, I need not say, I thankfully accepted. I felt
sure that M. Buguet did not know either my long-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>lost
grandmother or lamented maiden aunt, so that
any portraits I might get from him would be presumably
genuine. I sat; and over my manly form,
when the negative came to be cleaned, was a female
figure in the act of benediction. I have no notion
how she got there&mdash;for I watched every stage in the
operation, and selected my plate myself; but neither,
on the other hand, does she bear the faintest resemblance
to anybody I ever knew.</p>

<p>Still M. Buguet is not my modest photographer.
Elated by success so far, I called on the local gentleman
who advertised in the <i>Medium</i>; but the local
gentleman was "engaged." I wrote to the local
gentleman appointing an interview; but the local
gentleman replied not. Yet still his advertisement
remains; and I see in every spiritualistic album dozens
of "property" relations in the shape of quasi-spirits,
and wonder why the local gentleman would not take
me, so as to be immortalized in these pages.</p>

<p>Equally modest was the advertising Sibyl. I wrote
to the Sibyl, and somebody replied, and "respectfully
declined." But I was not to be done. There is more
than one Sibyl in the world. I called on No. 2 without
announcing my intention or sending in my name.
This Sibyl at once admitted me, and I mounted to
the first floor front of a respectable suburban lodging-house.</p>

<p>I waited anxiously for a long time, wondering
whether Sibyl was partaking of the onions, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
presence in that modest domicile was odoriferously
evidenced to my nose, though it was then scarcely
half-past one o'clock. Presently a portly middle-aged
man, who might have been Sibyl's youthful papa, or
rather aged husband, entered, wiping his mouth. He
had clearly been partaking of the fragrant condiment.</p>

<p>Where was Sibyl?</p>

<p>"She would be with us directly," the gentleman
said, varying the proceedings by picking his teeth in
the interim.</p>

<p>She <i>was</i> with us in a minute, and never, I suppose,
did picturesque anticipations more suddenly collapse
and come to grief than mine. I had pictured Sibyl a
bright ethereal being, and the realization of my ideal
weighed twelve stone, if an ounce. She was a big,
fleshy, large-boned woman of an utterly uncertain age,
not without considerable good-nature in her extensive
features; but the pervading idea that you had when
you looked at Sibyl was that there was <i>too much of
her</i>. I could not help thinking of the husband who
said he did not like a big wife: he preferred two small
ones; and then again I fell into wonderment as to
whether the man who was still engaged with his
dental apparatus was Sibyl's husband or papa.</p>

<p>I told them I was anxious to test Sibyl's powers;
and, with a few passes from his fat dumpy hands, the
man soon put her to sleep. It looked to me like an
after-dinner nap, but I was told it was magnetic. It
might have been. By the way, I had unmistakable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
evidence from my olfactory organ that Sibyl <i>had</i> been
eating onions.</p>

<p>I had provided myself with two locks of hair, as I
had heard that "psychometry" was among Sibyl's
qualifications. I handed her the first, and she immediately
proceeded to describe a series of tableaux
which appeared to pass through her mind. She kept
handling the lock of hair, and said, "The person to
whom this belongs is ill&mdash;weak," which was true
enough, but might, I thought, be a shot. I should
mention, however, that it was quite impossible Sibyl
could know me. She had not even heard my name.
She then described a bedroom, with some person&mdash;she
could not see what person&mdash;lying in bed, and a lady
in a blue dress bending over her. This, again, I
thought might flow out as a deduction from her
premises of the hair belonging to an invalid. The
blue dress was correct enough, but still so little
special as to be a very possible coincidence. She then,
however, startled me by saying, "I notice this, that
on the table by the bedside, where the bottles of
medicine are standing, milk has been spilt&mdash;a large
quantity&mdash;and not wiped up." This was a trivial
detail, not known to me at the time, but confirmed
on subsequent inquiry.</p>

<p>She then passed on to describe a second tableau,
where the same person in the blue dress was in a room
<i>all hung over with plates</i>, along with a gentleman
whom she described very accurately. He was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
occupant of the house where the patient lay, and,
having a hobby for old china, had turned his dining-room
into a sort of crockery shop by hanging it all
over with the delf.</p>

<p>This was curious enough, though not very convincing.
It seemed as though the influence of this
person who had given me the hair was stronger than
that of the hair itself. With the second lock of hair
we failed utterly. She said that also came from a
sick person, but a person not sick with the same
disease as the other. She was quite positive they
came from different people, and asked me to feel the
difference of texture. I am sorry, for Sibyl's sake,
to say they both came from the same person, and
were cut at the same time, though from different parts
of the head, which made one look silkier than the
other.</p>

<p>As a test of Sibyl's clairvoyance, this was not very
satisfactory. She read the inscription on a card when
her eyes were bandaged, pressing it to her forehead;
but then olden experiences in the way of blindman's
buff convince me that it is very difficult to say when
a person is properly blinded.</p>

<p>Altogether, then, I never quite got over my previous
disappointment at Sibyl's bulk. Had she been pretty
and frizzle-headed like Miss Annie Eva Fay, or like
Miss Showers or Miss Florence Cook, I might have
been disposed to make more of her coincidences and
to wink at her failures. We <i>are</i> so liable to be led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
away by our feelings in these matters. Sibyl was
large, had eaten onions, and would have been improved
if she had brushed her hair, and so I am
afraid I rather grudged the somewhat exorbitant fee
which the fat-handed man&mdash;not Sibyl&mdash;took and
pocketed in an interval of his dental pursuit, and I
passed out from that suburban lodging, none of us,
I fancy, very well satisfied with one another. I have
an idea I unconsciously expressed my inner feelings
of disappointment with Sibyl and something stronger
in reference to her male companion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<h3>SPIRITUALISTS AND CONJURERS.</h3>


<p>"How it's done" is the question which, in the
words of Dr. Lynn, we want to settle with reference
to his own or kindred performances, and, still more,
in the production of the phenomena known as spiritual.
I have spent some years of my existence in
a hitherto vain endeavour to solve the latter problem;
and the farther I go, the more the mystery seems to
deepen. Of late, the two opposed parties, the Spiritualists
and the Conjurers, have definitely entered
the arena, and declared war to the knife. Each
claims to be Moses, and denounces the others as
mere magicians. Mr. Maskelyne holds a dark s&eacute;ance,
professing to expose the spiritualistic ones; Dr. Lynn
brandishes against them his strong right arm upon
which is written in letters all of blood the name
of one's deceased grandmother, while, in return,
Dr. Sexton exposes the conjurers, and spoils one's
enjoyment of a hitherto enjoyable evening, by
showing "how it's done"&mdash;how the name of one's
departed relative is forged and painted early in the
afternoon, instead of "coming out" on the spot&mdash;and
in spots&mdash;like measles or nettle-rash (as we feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
defunct relations ought to come) or walking in and
out of the corded box at pleasure, and even going so
far as to give the address of the clever mechanist
down a by-street near Notting-hill Gate, who will
make the mysterious packing case to order in return
for a somewhat heavy "consideration."</p>

<p>I accepted Dr. Lynn's invitation to be present on
his "opening night;" and wondered, in passing, why
everybody should not make their cards of invitation
such thorough works of art as his. Now I am going
to do even-handed justice all the way round; and I
must say that Dr. Lynn's experiment of fastening
his attendant to a sort of penitential stool with
copper wire, surrounded by scrutineers from the
audience, and then making the man's coat come off,
and a ring pass over his arm, behind a simple rug
held in front of him, is quite as wonderful as anything
I have ever witnessed at a s&eacute;ance. It has the
great advantage of being done in the light, instead
of, as in Mr. Fay's case, in darkness, and without a
cabinet. In fact, I have no idea how it's done;
though I have no doubt the first time I see
Dr. Sexton he will point to something unsatisfactory
in the bolts to which that doorkeeper is fastened,
and give me the addresses of the ironmonger who
will sell me some like them, or the tailor who will
manufacture me a swallow tail coat with an imperceptible
slit down the back. Then again, I have, as
I said, seen young Mr. Sexton go in and out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
corded box, and I know how that's done; but
Dr. Lynn's man goes into three, one inside the other.
Well, I can understand that if Dr. Sexton's theory
be correct, it may perhaps be as easy to get into a
"nest" of three as into one box; but how, in the
name of nature&mdash;or art&mdash;does the nautical gentleman
get out of the double sack in which he is tied? I
cannot bring myself to print what Dr. Sexton's
theory of the box is, because it appears to be such a
wanton cruelty to "expose" things when people go
to the Egyptian Hall on purpose to be mystified.
I remember how the fact of having seen Dr. Sexton
do the trick of reading the names in the hat spoilt
my enjoyment of Dr. Lynn's experiment. He really
appeared quite bungling when I knew all he was
about. He did not, on this occasion, produce the
letters on his arm; but I saw he could quite easily
have done so, though the doing it would have been
no sort of reproduction of Mr. Forster's manifestation,
who showed you the name of some relative
when you had looked in on him quite unexpectedly.
I can quite understand how it is that the spiritualists,
who hold these matters to be sacred as revelation
itself&mdash;in fact, to be revelation itself, are shocked at
seeing their convictions denounced as trickery and
"exposed" on a public platform; but I confess I do
not quite see how they can adopt the tu quoque
principle, and "expose" Dr. Lynn and Messrs.
Maskelyne and Cooke as tricksters, because they do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
not pretend to be anything else. It would have
been fatal if the magicians had "found out" Moses,
and they wisely refrained from trying; but it would
have served no purpose for Moses to "find out" the
magicians: and it strikes me Moses would have
deemed it very infra dig. to make the attempt. The
two things stand on quite different grounds; and I
cannot help thinking that the spiritualists unwisely
concede a point when they accept the challenge of
the conjurers. I am quite aware that the theory of
the spiritualists makes of many a conjurer a medium
malgr&eacute; lui, and says he ought to come out in his
true colours. It was so Messrs. Maskelyne and
Cooke were originally introduced to a London public
at the Crystal Palace under the auspices of an
eminent spiritualist; but it really appears to me
that such an assertion amounts to begging the
question; for I doubt whether it would not "pay"
quite as well to come out boldly in Mr. Williams's
or Mr. Morse's line as in that of Dr. Lynn or
Mr. Maskelyne.</p>

<p>In a lengthened confab which I once had with
Mr. Maskelyne himself after one of his performances,
he told me that by constant attendance at the s&eacute;ances
of the Davenports he found out how that was all
done; and, being a working watchmaker, was able
soon to get the necessary apparatus constructed. I
must again be just, and state that while the cabinet
s&eacute;ance of Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke seems to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the exact counterpart of the Davenports', their dark
s&eacute;ance fails to reproduce that of the spiritualists as
the performances of Professor Pepper himself. True,
this latter gentleman does all his expos&eacute;s on a platform
which is sacred against all intrusion, and
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke assume to allow as
much examination as the spiritualists. But I myself,
who have seen Mr. Home float around Mr. S. C.
Hall's drawing-room, and handled him above and
below in transitu, quite fail to discern any reproduction
of that phenomenon in the heavy, lumbering
levitation of the lady by means of the scissors-like
apparatus behind her, which we are only privileged
to behold from the stalls. The dancing walking-stick
is as palpably made terpsichorean by a string
as the chairs I have seen cross Mr. Hall's drawing-room
in full light were not drawn by strings, for I
was able to look closely at them; and I do not know
how that was done.</p>

<p>Fresh from Dr. Lynn's really marvellous performances
of recent times, and with Messrs.
Maskelyne and Cooke's equally clever tricks in my
mind's eye, though not quite so recently, I still am
bold to say I believe there are still six of one to half-a-dozen
of the other. If the conjurers reproduce
the spiritual phenomena in some instances, the spiritualists
distance the conjurers in others. I speak
of phenomena only. The magicians produced many
of the same phenomena as Moses; but, even so, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
we are orthodox we must believe the source of such
manifestations to have been utterly different.</p>

<p>But I am, as I said, wise in my generation, and
stick to phenomena. I venture to think the conjurers
unwise in irritating the spiritualists, who are a growing
body, by placarding their entertainment as expos&eacute;s,
even though such announcements may "draw" the
non-spiritual public. I suppose, however, they understand
the science of advertising better than I do;
but I feel sure the spiritualists are unwise to follow
their example, because they have got nothing to
expose. Dr. Lynn or Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke
are as much pleased as conscientious mediums would
be shocked at being proved clever tricksters. The
only folks who are injured by being told "how it's
done," are the British Public, who pay their five
shillings to be mystified at the Egyptian Hall, just
as the spiritualists do in Lamb's Conduit Street.</p>

<p>If it is to come to a race for the championship&mdash;and
seriously it would seem that, having begun, the
two parties are bound to continue the strife&mdash;one
can scarcely imagine anything more attractive than
such a combined display of talent. Dr. Lynn gets
lots of people to come and see "How it's done"&mdash;the
gentleman with the mandolin is well worth a
visit, and I cannot guess how he does it&mdash;while
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke must really be making
a good thing of it. Mr. Williams's s&eacute;ances are decidedly
attractive (and how he does it has puzzled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
me for years, as I said), nor does the Progressive
Institute seem to decrease in interest; but let us
only picture the fascination of a long evening where
Pepper's Ghost should be pitted against John King,
Mrs. Guppy and Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke's
lady float in competition round the room or even
in from the suburbs, while the Davenports and
Dr. Lynn's man should wriggle out of or into iron
rings and their own dress coats! Until some such
contest takes place, the public mind will probably
gravitate towards the conjurers rather than the spiritualists,
and that through the actually suicidal
policy of the latter; because while the spiritualists
of necessity can show no visible source of their manifestations,
one of their own rank devotes himself to
aiding the conjurers by showing in reference to their
tricks, "How it's done." It would have been wiser,
surely, to stand upon dignity, and in a truly conservative
spirit (is it too late even now to reassume
it?), say, "These men are mediums, but it does not
suit their pockets to confess it."</p>

<p>Well, they are signs of the times. London loves
to be mystified, and would only have one instead of
manifold methods to be so if the spiritualists and
conjurers were to strike hands, and reduce us all to
the dead level of pure faith or relentless reason and
cold common sense!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<h3>PROS AND CONS OF SPIRITUALISM.</h3>


<p>It has been repeatedly urged upon me on previous
occasions, and also during the progress of these sheets
through the press, that I should make a clean breast
of my own belief or disbelief in spiritualism; that
besides being descriptive, I should go one step beyond
a mere catalogue of phenomena, and, to some extent
at least, theorize on this mysterious and generally
proscribed subject.</p>

<p>Let me say at the outset that against the proscription
of this, or indeed any topic which does not offend
against morals, I would at the very outset protest as
the height of unwisdom. Thus to taboo a subject is
at once to lend it a factitious interest, and more than
half to endorse its truth: and I believe modern
spiritualism has been very generally treated in this
way. Whether truth has gained by such indiscriminate
condemnation and prejudgment is, I think,
greatly open to question.</p>

<p>For myself, I have, from the first, steadily refused
to look upon spiritualism in this bugbear fashion.
The thing was either true or false&mdash;or, more probably
still, partly true and partly false: and I must bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
to bear on the discovery of its truth or falsehood, just
the same critical faculties that I should employ on
any other problem of common life. That, I fancy, is
no transcendental view of the matter; but just the
plain common sense way of going to work. It was,
at all events, right or wrong, the method I adopted to
get at such results as I proceed to make public. I
declined to be scared from the study either by Bogey
or my esteemed friend Mrs. Grundy, but went at it
just in the calm Baconian inductive method in which
I should have commenced any other study or pursuit.</p>

<p>What I want to do is to tabulate these results in
the same order as that in which they occurred to me;
and here I am met by a preliminary difficulty, not incidental
to this subject only, but common to any
narrative where we have to take a retrospective glance
over a number of years. We are apt to view the
subject from our present standpoint; and I shall try
to avoid this by quoting, whenever I can, what I published,
or committed to writing in the course of my
investigations. I shall not cull from others, because
I want to make this purely a personal narrative.</p>

<p>Let me add, too, I do not in the least expect
persons to believe what I say. Some, I think, will
regard me as a harmless (<i>if</i> a harmless) lunatic, on
account of certain statements I may have to make.
Others will consider the whole thing as decidedly unorthodox
and "wrong." For each of these issues I am
prepared. I would not have believed any one else if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
they had, prior to my experience, told me what I am
going to tell them here; and therefore I do not
expect them to believe me. All I hope to do is to
interest persons sufficiently in the subject to induce
them to look into the matter on their own account;
for verily I believe, as a distinguished spiritualist
once said to me, that this thing is either an important
truth or else one of the biggest swindles ever palmed
off upon humanity.</p>

<p>One word more, and I proceed to my narrative.
Of the three aspects under which it is possible to view
spiritualism, the scientific, the theological, and the
social, I shall not touch at all on the first since I am
not a scientific man; shall only glance at the second,
because this is not the place for a theological discussion.
I shall confine myself to the third, therefore,
which I call the social aspect; looking at the subject
as a question of the day, the truth about which we
are as much interested in solving as any other political
or social question, but the investigation of which need
not make us get excited and angry and call one another
bad names. I venture to hope that by these
means I may manage to compile a not unedifying or
uninteresting narrative, though our subject be withal
somewhat a ponderous one.</p>

<p>In order then to cover the preliminary part of my
narrative, and to let my readers somewhat into
the state of my own mind, when I had looked at the
subject for several years, I will quote some extracts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
from a paper I read before a society of spiritualists at
the Beethoven Rooms a few years ago under the title
"Am I a Spiritualist?" I may mention that the
assembly was divided, and never decided whether I
was or not, and what is more, I do not think they are
quite decided to the present day. I am a patient investigator
still; but I really do not feel it necessary to issue
perpetual bulletins as to the state of my convictions.</p>

<p>Taking as my thesis, then, the question, Am I a
Spiritualist? it will certainly appear, at first sight, I
said, that the person best qualified to answer this
question is precisely the person who puts it; but a
little consideration will, I think, show that the term
"Spiritualist" is one of such wide and somewhat
elastic meaning&mdash;in fact, that the word varies so
widely according to the persons who use it&mdash;that the
question may really be asked of one's self without
involving an inconsistency.</p>

<p>When persons ask me, as they often do, with a
look of unmitigated horror, "Is it possible that you,
a clergyman, are a spiritualist?" I am often inclined
to answer, "Yes, madam,"&mdash;(for it is generally a lady
who puts the question in that particular shape)&mdash;"I
<i>am</i> a spiritualist, and precisely because I am a clergyman.
I have had to express more than once my
unfeigned assent and consent to the Common Prayer
Book, and the Thirty Nine Articles; and that involves
belief in the inspiration of all the Bible (except the
Apocrypha), and the whole of that (<i>not</i> excepting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Apocrypha) is spiritual, or spiritualistic (if you prefer
the term) from beginning to end; and therefore it is
not <i>in spite of</i> my being a clergyman, but <i>because</i> I am
a clergyman that I am such a confirmed spiritualist."</p>

<p>I could answer thus, only I do not, simply because
to do so would be dishonest. I know my questioner
is using the word in an utterly different sense from
what I have thought proper to suppose. Besides
such an answer would only lead to argumentation,
and the very form of the question shows me the
person who puts it has made up her mind on this, as
probably on most other subjects; and when a feminine
mind is once made up (others than ladies have feminine
minds on these subjects) it is very little use
trying to alter it. I never do. I administer some
orthodox verbal sedative, and change the subject.
But even accepting the term in the way I know it is
meant to be used&mdash;say, for instance, as it comes from
the mouth of some conservative old gentleman, or supposed
scientific authority&mdash;one's medical man to wit&mdash;"Do
you believe in spiritualism?" meaning "Are
you such an ass as to believe in table-turning, and
rapping, and all that kind of nonsense?"&mdash;even so,
the question would admit of being answered by another
question; though I rarely enter so far on the matter
with those whose minds are evidently quite comfortably
made up on the matter. It is such a pity to interfere
with cherished opinions. I have found out that there
are Athanasian creeds in science as well as in theology;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and really, whilst they form recognised formul&aelig; in
the one or the other, it is positively lost labour to go
running one's head against them. The question I
want to ask&mdash;not the gentle apothecaries, but my
readers&mdash;is, What do you mean by believing in
spiritualism? Many of the phenomena of spiritualism
I cannot but believe, if I am to take my five
senses as my guides in this as in other matters, and
quite setting aside any credence I may give to
respectable testimony. When, however, I pass from
facts to theories, and am asked to account for those
facts, then I hesitate. There are some here, I know,
who will say that the spiritualist like the lady who
hesitates is lost&mdash;who think me as heterodox for
doing so, as the inflexible old ladies and the omniscient
apothecaries did on account of my even
deigning to look into the evidence of such phenomena.
I feel really that I have set myself up like an animated
ninepin to be knocked down by the first
thorough-going spiritualist who cares to bowl at me.
But whatever else they think of me&mdash;sceptical though
they deem me on subjects where perhaps you are,
many of you, a little prone to dogmatize&mdash;I claim
the character at least of an honest sceptic. I do not
altogether disavow the title, but I understand it to
mean "inquirer." I confess myself, after long years
of perfectly unbiassed inquiry, still an investigator&mdash;a
sceptic. It is the fashion to abuse St. Thomas
because he sought sensible proofs on a subject which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
it was certainly most important to have satisfactorily
cleared up. I never could read the words addressed
to him at all in the light of a rebuke&mdash;"Because
thou hast seen thou hast believed." The Church of
England treats the doubt of St. Thomas as permitted
by God "for the more confirmation of the faith;" and
I feel sure that professed spiritualists will not be so
inconsistent as to censure any man for examining
long and carefully matters which they believe to
admit of demonstration. I heard the most eloquent
of their advocates say, when comparing spiritual
with credal conviction, "Our motto no longer is 'I
believe,' but 'I know.'" Belief may be instantaneous,
but knowledge will be gradual; and so it is
that, standing at a certain fixed point in very many
years' study of spiritualism, I pause, and&mdash;so to say,
empanelling a jury&mdash;ask the question it seems I ought
to answer at others' asking&mdash;Am I a Spiritualist?</p>

<p>One word of apology further before entering on the
details of the matter. It will be inevitable that the
first personal pronoun shall recur frequently in the
course of this paper, and that so the paper shall seem
egotistical. The very question itself sounds so. I am
not vain enough to suppose that it matters much to
anybody here whether I am a spiritualist or not,
except in so far as I may be in any sense a representative
man. I believe I am. That is, I believe,
nay, am sure, that a great many persons go as far as
I do, and stop where I stop. There is a largish body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of investigators, I believe, dangling there, like
Mahomet's coffin, between heaven and earth, and it
would be a charity to land them somewhere. Of the
clerical mind, I do <i>not</i> claim to be a representative,
because the clerical mind, qu&acirc; clerical, has made up
itself that the phenomena in question are diabolical.
Of course if I accepted this theory my question would
be utterly irrelevant, and I should claim a place
among the spiritualists at once. The diabolical
people not only accept the phenomena, but admit
their spiritual origin, and, more than this, identify
the spirits. They are in point of fact the most
thorough-going spiritualists of all.</p>

<p>In sketching their creed, I have mentioned the
three stages through which most minds must go in
this matter. Some few, indeed, take them by intuition,
but most minds have to plod patiently along the path
of inquiry, as I have done. The first stage is acceptance
of the phenomena, the second the assignment of
those phenomena to spirits as their source, the third
is identification of these spirits.</p>

<p>1. On the first part of my subject I shall venture
to speak with some boldness. I am not a philosopher,
therefore I can afford to do so. I shall suppose my
five senses to serve my purposes of observation, as
they would be supposed to serve me if I were giving
evidence in a court of justice. If I saw a table move,
I shall say <i>it did</i> move, not "it appeared to move."
I do this in my capacity of a commonplace instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a philosophical investigator; and I must say, if I
were, as I supposed myself just now, in the witness-box,
with a good browbeating counsel cross-examining
me on this point, I would rather have to defend the
position of the commonplace inquirer than the
philosopher, pledged to defend the philosophy of the
last fifty years, and bound hand and foot by his
philosophic Athanasian Creed, and I don't know how
many articles, more than thirty-nine, I fancy.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the year 1856, or beginning of
1857, then, I was residing in Paris, that lively capital
being full of Mr. Home's doings at the Tuileries. At
that time I knew nothing, even of table-turning. I
listened to the stories of Mr. Home and the Emperor
as mere canards. I never stopped to question whether
the matter were true, because I in my omniscience
knew it to be impossible. It is this phase of my
experience that makes me so unwilling to argue with
the omniscient people now; it is such a waste of
time. At this period my brother came to visit me,
and he had either been present himself or knew
persons who had been present at certain s&eacute;ances at
Mr. Rymer's. He seemed staggered, if not convinced,
by what he had heard or seen, and this staggered me
too, for he was not exactly a gullible person and
certainly by no means "spiritual." I was staggered,
I own, but then I was omniscient, and so I did what
is always safest, laughed at the matter. He suggested
that we should try experiments instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
laughing, and, not being a philosopher, I consented.
We sat at the little round table in our tiny salon,
which soon began to turn, then answered questions,
and finally told us that one of the three, viz., my
wife, was a medium, and consequently we could
receive communications. I went to a side table and
wrote a question as to the source of the manifestations,
keeping it concealed from those at the table,
and not rejoining them myself. The answer spelt out
by them was&mdash;"We, the spirits of the departed, are
permitted thus to appear to men." Again I wrote&mdash;"What
object is served by your doing so?" The
answer was&mdash;"It may make men believe in God."
I have said I am not a philosopher, therefore I do not
mind confessing that I collapsed. I struck my flag
at once as to the <i>impossibility</i> of the matter. At the
same time I did not&mdash;as I know many ardent spiritualists
will think I ought&mdash;at once swallow the
whole thing, theory and all. I should not have
believed if a man had told me this; was it to be expected
that I should believe a table? Honesty is my
best policy; and I had better, therefore, say I
was never so utterly knocked over by anything that
occurred to me in my life before or since. My visage
of utter, blank astonishment is a joke against me to
this hour. We pursued the inquiry almost nightly
during the remainder of my stay in Paris&mdash;up to late
in the summer of 1857 that is&mdash;and also on our return
to England; but, strangely as it seems to me now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
considering how we began, we did it more as a pastime
than anything else. The only time we were
serious was when my wife and I sat alone, as we often
did. Of course when I came to inquire at all into
the matter I was met by Faraday's theory of involuntary
muscular action, and also with the doctrine of
unconscious cerebration&mdash;I was quite ready to accept
either. My own position, as far as I can recall it,
then was that the spiritual agency was "not proven."
My wife had great reluctance against admitting the
spiritual theory. I was simply passive; but two circumstances
seemed to me to militate against the
theories I have mentioned: (1.) The table we used
for communicating was a little gimcrack French
affair, the top of which spun round on the slightest
provocation, and no force whatever, not even a philosopher's,
applied to the surface would do more than
spin the top round; but when the table turned, <i>it
turned bodily, legs and all</i>. (2.) As to that ponderously
difficult theory of unconscious cerebration communicated
by involuntary muscular action, whenever we
asked any questions as to the future, we were instantly
checked, and told it was better that the future
should not be revealed to us. I was anxious about a
matter in connexion with an election to an appointment
in England, and we asked some questions as to
what form the proceedings would take. The reply
was that certain candidates would be selected from
the main body, and the election made from these.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
I thought I had caught the table in an inconsistency,
and said&mdash;"There now you <i>have</i> told us something
about the future." It immediately replied&mdash;"No, I
have not; the matter is already settled in the minds
of the examiners." Whence came that answer?
Certainly not from our minds, for it took us both by
surprise. I could multiply a hundredfold instances
of this kind, but, of course, to educated spiritualists
these are mere A B C matters; whilst non-spiritualists
would only accept them on the evidence of their
own senses. I do not mean to say they actually
question the facts to the extent of doubting one's
veracity, or else nearly all testimony must go for
nothing; but there is in these matters always room
for doubting whether the narrator has not been deceived;
and, moreover, even if accepted at secondhand,
I doubt whether facts so accepted ever become,
as it were, assimilated, so as to have any practical
effect.</p>

<p>My facts at all events came at first-hand. I suppose
a man need not be considered credulous for
believing in his own wife, and nearly all these phenomena
were produced by my wife's mediumship. It
was not until late in the year 1865 or early in 1866,
that I ever sat with a professional medium. My
wife, moreover, from first to last, has steadily disbelieved
the spirit theory, so that she has not laid
herself open to suspicion of being prejudiced in favour
of the subject. She has been emphatically an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>voluntary,
nay, even unwilling agent in these
matters.</p>

<p>During these eight or nine years the communications
were generally given by automatic writing,
though sometimes still by tilting of the table. I am
very much tempted to quote two, which linger in my
recollection, principally, I believe, because they were
so destructive of the cerebration theory, besides being
curious in themselves. I kept no records until a later
date. At present all rests on tradition. Each of
these cases occurred in presence of myself, my wife,
and a pupil. In the former, he was a young Englishman,
who had lived a great deal abroad, whose mother
was a Catholic and father a Protestant. He had been
brought up in the latter faith; and when I desired
him to ask a mental question, he asked, in French&mdash;that
being the language most familiar to him&mdash;"Is
the Catholic or the Protestant religion the true one?"
Mark you, he never articulated this, or gave the least
hint that he was asking in French. He did it in
fact, spontaneously. My wife immediately wrote
"Ta m&egrave;re est Catholique"&mdash;so far, in French, with
difficulty, and then breaking off into English,
"Respect her faith."</p>

<p>In the second instance, my pupil was a French
youth, a Catholic, who was living in my house, but
used to go to his priest frequently to be prepared for
his first communion. One day when we were writing,
this youth asked who the communicating spirit was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and received in reply the name of Louis D&mdash;&mdash;.
The name was totally unknown to us; but to our
surprise when the youth came back from his visit to
the priest that day he informed us that his reverend
instructor had dwelt strongly on the virtues of Louis
D&mdash;&mdash;. Seeing the boy look amazed as the name
which had just been given at our s&eacute;ance was pronounced,
the priest inquired the reason; and, on
being informed, of course directed his catechumen
never to join in such diablerie again.</p>

<p>The impression, then, left on my mind by these
years of desultory dabbling with&mdash;rather than study
of&mdash;the subject, was decidedly that the phenomena of
spiritualism were genuine. Looking at the matter
from my present standpoint and frame of mind, it
seems to me incredible that I should have thought
so little of the source of the phenomena. It was, as
I said, that I was then dabbling with, not studying,
the subject.</p>

<p>But even without advancing beyond this rudimentary
stage, I saw a very serious result produced.
I saw men who literally believed in nothing, and who
entered on this pursuit in a spirit of levity, suddenly
staggered with what appeared to afford even possibility
of demonstration of another world, and the
continued existence of the spirit after bodily death.
I believe a great many persons who have never felt
doubt themselves are unaware of the extent to which
doubt prevails amongst young men especially; and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
have seen many instances of this doubt being&mdash;if not
removed&mdash;shaken to its very foundation by their witnessing
the phenomena of spiritualism. "Yes, but
did it make good consistent Christians of them?"
asks one of my excellent simple-minded objectors.
Alas! my experience does not tell me that good consistent
Christians are so readily made. Does our
faith&mdash;I might have asked&mdash;make <i>us</i> the good consistent
Christians it ought to do, and would do
perhaps, if we gave it fair play?</p>

<p>So, then, my study of spiritualism had been
purely phenomenal. It was a very sad and serious
event which drove me to look deeper. Some people
will, I daresay, think it strange that I allude to this
cause here. The fact that I do so shows, at all events,
that I have looked seriously at spiritualism since. It
was none other than the loss, under painful circumstances,
of one of my children. Now I had always
determined that, in the event of my losing one near
and dear to me, I would put spiritualism to the test,
by trying to communicate with that one. This will,
I think, show that, even then, if I did not accept the
spiritualistic theory, I did not by any means consider
the position untenable. The very day after my boy's
death, I got his mother to sit, and found she was
writing a little loving message purporting to come
from him. This, a sceptic would say, was natural
enough under the circumstances. I said no word,
but sat apart, and kept writing "Who is it that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
communicates? write your name." Suddenly the
sentence was broken off, and the child's name written,
though I had not expressed my wish aloud. This
was strange; but what followed was stranger still.
Of course, so far all might have been fairly attributed
to cerebration&mdash;if such a process exists. It was
natural enough, it might be urged, that the mother,
previously schooled in the belief of the probability of
communication, should write in her lost child's name.
For years the same thing never occurred again, though
we sat night after night for the purpose of renewing
such communications. I can certainly say of myself
that, at this time, I <i>was</i> a spiritualist&mdash;as thorough
and devout a one as any existing; and the fact
that I was so, when carried away by my feelings,
makes me the more cautious to test and try myself
as to whether my feelings may not sometimes sway
my judgment even now; whether the wish be not
often father of the thought, at all events in the identification
of spiritual communications, and so, possibly,
of the spiritual nature of such communications altogether.</p>

<p>However, from this time&mdash;the autumn of 1865&mdash;my
spiritual studies underwent an entire change&mdash;they
<i>were</i> studies&mdash;serious studies. I now kept a
careful journal of all communications, which journal
I continued for three years, so that I can trace all my
fluctuations of opinion&mdash;for I did fluctuate&mdash;during
that period. Now, too, it was necessary for me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
consult those who had already gone deeply into the
subject; and the record of my experiences would be
both imperfect and ungracious if I did not here
acknowledge the prompt kindness of the two gentlemen
to whom I applied&mdash;Mr. Benjamin Coleman
and Mr. Samuel Carter Hall. I was comparatively a
stranger to each of them, but they replied to my inquiries
with the most ready courtesy, and I am happy
to date my present friendship with each of them
from this time. At Mr. Hall's I met Mr. Home, and
on the second occasion of my doing so, not only saw
him float, but handled him above and below during
the whole of the time he floated round Mr. Hall's
drawing-room. I am unphilosophical enough to say
that I entirely credit the evidence of my senses on
that occasion, and am as certain that Mr. Home was
in space for five minutes as I am of my own
existence. The ordinary solution of cranes and
other cumbrous machinery in Mr. Hall's drawing-room
I cannot credit, for I think we should have seen
them, and I am sure I should have felt ropes round
Mr. Home's body. Chairs went from one end of the
room to the other <i>in full light</i>; and nobody had previously
tumbled over strings and wires, so that I don't
think there could have been any there.</p>

<p>I fancy, as far as any order is traceable in the somewhat
erratic course of spiritualistic experiences, that
most people arrive at spiritualism vi&acirc; mesmerism.
It so happened that this order was exactly inverted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
in my case. It was not until 1866 that I found I
possessed the power of magnetism, and moreover, had
in my house a subject whom Alphonse Didier (with
whom I afterwards put myself in communication) declared
to be "one in a thousand." Some of the
details of this lady's case are very curious, but this is
scarcely the place to dilate upon them further than as
they affected my spiritualistic studies. She passed
with extraordinary ease into the condition of lucidity,
when she was conscious only of basking in light,
anxious to be magnetized more deeply so as to get
more thoroughly into the light, and, moreover, aware
only of the existence of those who had passed away
from earth. She knew they were with her: said I
<i>must</i> know it, as I was there too, and that it was I
only who would not "let her" see them. The fact
that "our life is twofold" was to me most marvellously
brought out by my magnetic treatment of this
lady; and, moreover, the power of influencing action
could not fail to be suggestive of the truth of one of
the cardinal doctrines of spiritualism&mdash;that we are
thus influenced by disembodied spirits, as I, an embodied
spirit, could influence another spirit in the
body. Some of the likes and dislikes which I, so to
say, produced then in 1866 have remained to the
present hour. For instance, one particular article of
food (I will not mention what, or it would be fatal to
my reader's gravity), for which she previously had a
penchant, I rendered so distasteful to her that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
very smell of it now makes her uncomfortable. I
must plead guilty to having experimented somewhat
in this way; but what a wonderful light it sheds upon
the great problem of the motives of human action!
By the simple exercise of my will I could make my
patient perform actions the most abhorrent to her.
For instance&mdash;the ladies will appreciate this power&mdash;at
a time when crinolines were extensive, I made that
poor creature draggle about in a costume conspicuous
by the absence of crinoline, and making her look like
some of the ladies out of a Noah's ark.</p>

<p>During this period my wife and I constantly sat
alone, and she wrote. It is no disrespect to her to
say that writing is not her forte, but the communications
she made in this way were exceedingly
voluminous, and couched in a particularly happy
style, though on subjects far above the range of
ordinary compositions. We never obtained a single
communication purporting to come from our child,
but the position claimed by the communicating intelligence
was that of his spirit-guardian.</p>

<p>Having now probably said enough in these confessions
to convince every non-spiritualist that I am
insane, because I believed the evidence of my senses,
and even ventured to look into matters so unorthodox
and unscientific as mesmerism and spiritualism, I go
on to "make a clean breast," and set myself wrong
with the other moiety of my readers. I must
candidly confess that the experiences of this year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
(1866) did not confirm my sudden conviction of the
spiritual agency in these phenomena. I drifted
back, in fact, to my previous position, accepting the
phenomena, but holding the cause an open question.
The preface to the book, "From Matter to Spirit,"
exactly expressed&mdash;shall I say expresses?&mdash;my state
of mind. There is one passage in that preface which
appears to me to clinch the difficulty&mdash;"I am perfectly
convinced that I have both seen and heard,
in a manner which should make unbelief impossible,
things called spiritual, which cannot be taken by a
reasonable being to be capable of explanation by imposture,
coincidence, or mistake. So far I feel the
ground firm under me. But when it comes to what
is the cause of these phenomena I find I cannot adopt
any explanation which has yet been suggested. If
I were bound to choose among things which I can
conceive, I should say that there is some sort of action&mdash;some
sort of combination of will, intellect, and physical
power, which is not that of any of the human
beings present. But thinking it very likely that the
universe may contain a few agencies, say half a million,
about which no man knows anything, I cannot but
suspect that a small proportion of these agencies, say
five thousand, may be severally competent to the production
of all the phenomena, or may be quite up to
the task among them. <i>The physical explanations
which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient:
the spiritual hypothesis is sufficient but ponderously difficult.</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
This statement is natural enough from the
scientific side of the question. Perhaps the theological
inquirer, taking the fact into consideration that
Scripture certainly concedes the spiritual origin of
kindred phenomena, would rather reverse the statement,
and say (what I individually feel) that the
psychological explanation is the ponderously difficult&mdash;the
pneumatological, the comparatively easy one.</p>

<p>It is now no secret that the author of this excellent
treatise, is Professor De Morgan; and I can only say
that if I am accused of heterodoxy, either from the
spiritualist or anti-spiritualist side of the discussion,
I am not ashamed to be a heretic in such company.
Let me put the matter in the present tense, indicative
mood&mdash;that is the state of my opinion on the cause of
the phenomena. Admitting the facts, I hold the
spiritual theory to be "not proven," but still to be a
hypothesis deserving our most serious consideration,
not only as being the only one that will cover all the
facts, but as the one I believe invariably given in
explanation by the intelligence that produces the
phenomena, even when, as in our case, all those
present are sceptical of or opposed to such a theory.</p>

<p>3. It may perhaps sound illogical if, after stating
that I hold the spiritual origin of these phenomena
unproven, I go on to speak of the identification of the
communicating spirit; but I hope I have made it
clear that, even if I do not consider the spiritualistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
explanation demonstrated, it is still a hypothesis
which has much in its favour.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the subject of identification
in the case of the first communication purporting
to come from our little child, and how no such communications
were received for a period of some years
after. In December, 1866, I went to the Marshalls',
entering as an entire stranger, and sitting down at
the table. I saw some strong physical manifestations&mdash;a
large table being poised in space, in full light, for
some seconds. It was signified there was a spirit
present who wished to communicate, and the message
given by raps to me was&mdash;"Will you try to think of
us more than you have done?" I asked the name,
and my child's was correctly given, though I had not
been announced, and I have no reason to believe my
name was known. The place where he passed away
from earth was also correctly specified. I then asked
for my father, and his name was correctly given, and a
message added, which I cannot say was equally suggestive
of individuality. It was&mdash;"Bright inspiration
will dawn upon your soul, and do not hide your
light under a bushel."</p>

<p>Another case in which I tested individuality
strongly, with utter absence of success, was also
brought before me somewhat earlier in this year. I
was sent for by a lady who had been a member of
my congregation, and who had taken great interest in
these questions. She was suddenly smitten down with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
mortal disease, and I remained with her almost to the
last&mdash;indeed, I believe her last words were addressed to
me, and referred to this very subject of identification&mdash;she
consulting <i>me</i> as to the great problem she was
then on the very point of solving! As soon as she
had gone from us, I went home, and tried to communicate
with her. I was informed that her spirit
was present, and yet every detail as to names, &amp;c.,
was utterly wrong.</p>

<p>In the spring of the following year I went again to
the Marshalls', in company with one or two other
persons, my own object being to see if I could obtain
communication from the spirit of a highly-gifted lady
who had recently died&mdash;and also, I may mention&mdash;had
been the medium of my previous slight acquaintance
with Mr. Coleman. She was very much interested
in these matters, and, when in this world,
her great forte had been writing. She published a
volume of poems, which won the special commendation
of the late Charles Dickens, and her
letters were most characteristic ones. I mentioned
that I wished to communicate with the spirit I was
thinking of, and said I should be quite satisfied if the
initials were correctly given. Not so&mdash;the whole
three names were immediately given in full. I do
not feel at liberty to mention the names; but the
surname was one that nine out of ten people always
spelt wrongly (just as they do <i>my</i> name), but on this
occasion it was correctly spelt. I asked for a cha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>racteristic
message, and received the words, "I am
saved, and will now save others;"&mdash;about as unlike
my friend's ordinary style as possible. It may be
said her nature had undergone revolution, but that
was not the question. The test was that something
should be given, identifying the spirit, by the style
of its <i>former</i> writing while embodied on earth.</p>

<p>With one more case, bearing on this subject of
identity, and bringing the matter up to the present
date, I feel I may advantageously close this portion
of my experiences&mdash;though as I do so, I am thoroughly
dissatisfied with myself to find how much I
have left unsaid. It is so difficult to put these things
on paper, or in any way to convey them to another;&mdash;most
difficult of all for one unblessed with leisure,
and combining in his single self the pursuits of some
three laborious callings.</p>

<p>Last year, whilst sitting at Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s, I was
touched by a hand which seemed to me that of a
small girl, and which attracted my attention by the
way it lingered in mine&mdash;this would amuse Professor
Pepper&mdash;and the pertinacity with which it took off
my ring. However, I never took any steps to
identify the owner of the hand.</p>

<p>Some few months ago, my wife and I were sitting,
and a communication came ostensibly from our
child. It was quite unexpected; and I said, "I
thought you could not communicate." "I could
not before," was the reply. "But you have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
tried me for two years." This we found was true;
but we actually had to look into dates to ascertain it.
He added, that he always was present at s&eacute;ances
where I went, and especially at Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s. It
will, I daresay, sound strange to non-spiritualists,
but the initiated can understand the conversational
tone we adopt. I said, "But, Johnny, that was not
your hand that touched me at Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s. It was
too large." The answer was, "No! it was Charlie's
turn." I said, "What <i>do</i> you mean by Charlie's
turn?" The word was rewritten with almost
petulant haste and remarkable plainness, "Charlie's
<i>twin</i>." Charlie is my eldest boy, and his twin-brother
was still-born. He would be between thirteen
and fourteen years of age, and that was precisely the
sized hand I felt. This was curious; as the event
had occurred a year before, and such an explanation
had never even crossed my mind. I was promised
that, if I would go to Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;'s again, each of
the children would come and place a hand in mine.
I went to the ordinary s&eacute;ance some time before
Christmas, and was then told that the test I wished&mdash;which
I had not then specified&mdash;should be given
to me at a private s&eacute;ance. We had the private s&eacute;ance,
but nothing occurred.</p>

<p>Such is my case. To one section of my readers I
shall appear credulous, to another hard of belief. I
believe that I represent the candid inquirer. As for
being scared off from the inquiry by those who call it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
unorthodox, or cry out "fire and brimstone," I should
as little think of heeding them as the omniscient
apothecaries who smile at my believing in mesmerism.
If a man's opinions are worth anything&mdash;if he has
fought his way to those opinions at the bayonet's
point&mdash;he will not be scared off from them by the
whole bench of Bishops on the one side, or the
College of Surgeons on the other. Not that I for
one moment plead guilty to heterodoxy, either scientific
or theological. I am not, as I have said several
times, a philosopher, but I believe it is scientific to
hold as established what you can prove by experiment.
I don't think my creed contains a jot or tittle beyond
this. And as for theological orthodoxy, I simply
take my stand upon the Canons of the Church of
England. If all this spiritual business is delusion,
how comes it that No. 72 of the Constitutions and
Canons Ecclesiastical says: "Neither shall any
minister, not licensed, attempt, upon any pretence
whatever, either of possession or obsession, by fasting
or prayer, to cast out any devil or devils?"</p>

<p>The question, however, is not of this kind of orthodoxy.
It rather refers to the creed of spiritualism.
The question, in fact, to which I and the many who
think with me pause for a reply, is:&mdash;Allowing, as we
do, some of the phenomena&mdash;but considering the
pneumatological explanation hypothetical only&mdash;and
therefore any identification of communicating intelligence
impossible&mdash;are we (for I am sincerely tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of that first person singular, and glad to take
refuge in a community), are we, or are we not,
spiritualists?</p>

<p>So far was I able to commit myself in my address
to the spiritualists of Harley Street. I was, I confess,
greatly pleased when, in 1869, the Dialectical Society
took up this matter, because I felt they were just the
people to look into it dispassionately. They were
bound to no set of opinions, but regarded everything
as an open question, accepting nothing save as the
conclusion of a logical argument. I joined the
Society&mdash;straining my clerical conscience somewhat to
do so&mdash;and eventually formed one of the committee
appointed by the Society to inquire into the matter,
and having a sub-committee sitting at my own house.
This, however, broke up suddenly, for I found even
philosophers were not calm in their examination of
unpalatable facts. One gentleman who approached
the subject with his mind fully made up, accused the
lady medium of playing tricks, and me of acting
showman on the occasion. As there was no method
of shunting this person, I was obliged to break up
my sub-committee. To mention spiritualism to these
omniscient gentlemen is like shaking a red rag at a
bull. As a case in point (though, of course, I do not
credit these gentlemen with the assumption of omniscience),
I may quote the replies of Professor Huxley
and Mr. G. H. Lewes to the Society's invitation to sit
on their committee:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I regret that I am unable to accept the invitation
of the Council of the Dialectical Society to
co-operate with a committee for the investigation of
'spiritualism;' and for two reasons. In the first
place, I have no time for such an inquiry, which
would involve much trouble and (unless it were unlike
all inquiries of that kind I have known) much annoyance.
In the second place, I take no interest in the
subject. The only case of 'spiritualism' I have had
the opportunity of examining into for myself, was as
gross an imposture as ever came under my notice.
But supposing the phenomena to be genuine&mdash;they
do not interest me. If anybody would endow me
with the faculty of listening to the chatter of old
women and curates in the nearest cathedral town, I
should decline the privilege, having better things to do.</p>

<p>"And if the folk in the spiritual world do not talk
more wisely and sensibly than their friends report
them to do, I put them in the same category.</p>

<p>"The only good that I can see in a demonstration
of the truth of 'spiritualism' is to furnish an additional
argument against suicide. Better live a
crossing-sweeper than die and be made to talk
twaddle by a 'medium' hired at a guinea a s&eacute;ance.</p>

<p class='indent'>"I am, Sir, &amp;c.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">T. H. Huxley.</span></p>

<p class='indentdate'>"29th January, 1869."</p>

<p>Confessedly Professor Huxley only tried one experiment.
I cannot help thinking if he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
approached the subject with a certain amount of prejudice
he would have been content to "Try again."
The side-hit at curates of course I appreciate!</p>

<p>"Dear Sir,&mdash;I shall not be able to attend the investigation
of 'spiritualism;' and in reference to
your question about suggestions would only say that
the one hint needful is that all present should distinguish
between facts and inferences from facts. When
any man says that phenomena are produced by <i>no</i>
known physical laws, he declares that he knows the
laws by which they are produced.</p>

<p class='indent'>"Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">G. H. Lewes.</span></p>

<p class='indentdate'>"Tuesday, 2nd February, 1869."</p>

<p>I am not, as I have said, a scientific man, nor do I
advance the slightest pretensions to genius; therefore
I have no doubt it is some mental defect on
my part which prevents my seeing the force of Mr.
G. H. Lewes's concluding sentence. I have worked
at it for years and am compelled to say I cannot
understand it.</p>

<p>I sat, however, through the two years' examination
which the Society gave to the subject; and it is not
anticipating the conclusion of this chapter to say I
was fully able to concur in the report they subsequently
issued, the gist of which is continued in the
final paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In presenting their report, your committee taking
into consideration the high character and great in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>telligence
of many of the witnesses to the more extraordinary
facts, the extent to which their testimony
is supported by the reports of the sub-committees,
and the absence of any proof of imposture or delusion
as regards a large portion of the phenomena; and
further, having regard to the exceptional character of
the phenomena, the large number of persons in every
grade of society and over the whole civilized world
who are more or less influenced by a belief in their
supernatural origin, and to the fact that no philosophical
explanation of them has yet been arrived at,
deem it incumbent upon them to state their conviction
that the subject is worthy of more serious attention
and careful investigation than it has hitherto received."</p>

<p>With those cautiously guarded words I venture to
think that any one who even reads the body of evidence
contained in the Dialectical Society's report
will be able to coincide.</p>

<p>To return to my more personal narrative.</p>

<p>As far as I can trace any order in this somewhat
erratic subject, I think I may venture to say that the
manifestations of the last few years have assumed a
more <i>material</i> form than before. It sounds a little
Hibernian to say so, I know; but I still retain the
expression. Supposing, for the moment, that the
effects were produced by spirits, the control of the
medium for the production of trance, spirit-voice,
automatic writing, or even communications through
raps and tilts of the table was much more intellectual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>&mdash;less
physical than those of which I now have to
speak&mdash;namely, the production of the materialized
Spirit Faces and Spirit Forms.</p>

<p>Two phases of manifestation, I may mention in
passing, I have not seen&mdash;namely, the elongation of the
body, and the fire test&mdash;both as far as I know peculiar
to Mr. Home: nor again have I had personal experience
of Mrs. Guppy's a&euml;rial transit, or Dr. Monk's nocturnal
flight from Bristol to Swindon. Nothing of the
kind has ever come at all within the sphere of my
observation: therefore I forbear to speak about it.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the delight with which I received
a letter from a gentleman connected with the
literature of spiritualism, informing me that materialized
Spirit Faces had at last been produced in full
light, and inviting me to come and see. I was
wearied of dark s&eacute;ances, of fruit and flowers brought
to order. John King's talk wearied me; and Katie's
whispers had become fatally familiar: so I went in
eagerly for the new sensation, and communicated my
results to the world in the two papers called <i>Spirit
Faces</i> and <i>Spirit Forms</i>, the former published in
<i>Unorthodox London</i>, the latter in Chapter 43 of the
present volume. This class of manifestation has since
become very common. I cannot say I ever considered
it very satisfactory. I have never discovered
any trickery&mdash;and I assure my readers I have kept
my eyes and ears very wide open&mdash;but there are in
such manifestations facilities for charlatanism which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
it is not pleasant to contemplate. This, let me continually
repeat, is a purely personal narrative, and
I have never seen any Spirit Face or Form that I
could in the faintest way recognise. Others, I know,
claim to have done so; but I speak strictly of what
has occurred to myself. The same has been the case
with Spirit Photographs. I have sat, after selecting
my own plate and watching every stage in the process;
and certainly over my form there has been a shadowy
female figure apparently in the act of benediction;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but
I cannot trace resemblance to any one I ever saw in the
flesh. Perhaps I have been unfortunate in this respect.</p>

<p>Very similar to Miss Cook's mediumship was that
of Miss Showers; a young lady whom I have met
frequently at the house of a lady at the West-end of
London, both the medium and her hostess being quite
above suspicion. In this case, besides the face and
full form we have singing in a clear baritone voice
presumably by a spirit called Peter&mdash;who gives himself
out as having been in earth-life, I believe, a not
very estimable specimen of a market-gardener. I am
exceedingly puzzled how to account for these things.
I dare not suspect the medium; but even granting
the truth of the manifestations, they seem to me to
be of a low class which one would only come into
contact with under protest and for the sake of evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Crookes used to explain, and Serjeant Cox still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
explains these manifestations as being the products of a
so-called Psychic Force&mdash;a term which I below define.
Although I am as little inclined to hero-worship, and
care as little for large names as any man living, yet it
is quite impossible not to attach importance to the
testimony of these gentlemen; one so eminent in the
scientific world, and privileged to write himself F.R.S.,
the other trained to weigh evidence and decide
between balanced probabilities. But it would seem
that while Psychic Force might cover the ground of
my earlier experiences, it singularly fails to account
for the materializations, and obliges us to relegate
them to the category of fraud, unless we accept them
as being what they profess to be. This I believe
Serjeant Cox ruthlessly does. He claims as we have
seen to have "caught" Miss Showers, and was not, I
believe, convinced by Miss Cook. Mr. Crookes was:
and, when we remember that Mr. Wallace, the eminent
naturalist, and Mr. Cromwell Varley, the electrician,
both accept the spiritual theory, it really looks as
though the scientific mind was more open to receive&mdash;perhaps
driven to receive&mdash;this which I frankly concede
to be the only adequate cause for the effects,
while the legal mind still remains hair-splitting upon
conflicting evidence. Whereabouts the theological
mind is I do not quite know&mdash;perhaps still dangling
between the opposite poles of Faith and Reason, and
dubiously debating with me "Am I a Spiritualist or
not?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>In a recent pamphlet reprinted from the Quarterly
Journal of Science, Mr. Crookes thus compendiously
sums up the various theories which have been invented
to account for spiritualistic phenomena, and,
in so doing, incidentally defines his now discarded
theory of Psychic Force which owns Mr. Serjeant
Cox for its patron:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Theory.</i>&mdash;The phenomena are all the results
of tricks, clever mechanical arrangements, or legerdemain;
the mediums are impostors, and the rest of the
company fools.</p>

<p>It is obvious that this theory can only account for
a very small proportion of the facts observed. I am
willing to admit that some so-called mediums of whom
the public have heard much are arrant impostors who
have taken advantage of the public demand for
spiritualistic excitement to fill their purses with easily
earned guineas; whilst others who have no pecuniary
motive for imposture are tempted to cheat, it would
seem, solely by a desire for notoriety.</p>

<p><i>Second Theory.</i>&mdash;The persons at a s&eacute;ance are the
victims of a sort of mania or delusion, and imagine phenomena
to occur which have no real objective existence.</p>

<p><i>Third Theory.</i>&mdash;The whole is the result of conscious
or unconscious cerebral action.</p>

<p>These two theories are evidently incapable of embracing
more than a small portion of the phenomena,
and they are improbable explanations for even those.
They may be dismissed very briefly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>I now approach the "spiritual" theories. It
must be remembered that the word "spirits" is used
in a very vague sense by the generality of people.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Theory.</i>&mdash;The result of the spirit of the
medium, perhaps in association with the spirits of
some or all of the people present.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Theory.</i>&mdash;The actions of evil spirits or devils,
personifying who or what they please, in order to undermine
Christianity and ruin men's souls.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Theory.</i>&mdash;The actions of a separate order of
beings, living on this earth, but invisible and immaterial
to us. Able, however, occasionally to manifest
their presence; known in almost all countries and
ages as demons not necessarily bad, gnomes, fairies,
kobolds, elves, goblins, Puck, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Theory.</i>&mdash;The actions of departed human
beings&mdash;the spiritual theory <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Theory.</i>&mdash;(<i>The Psychic Force Theory</i>).&mdash;This
is a necessary adjunct to the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th
theories, rather than a theory by itself.</p>

<p>According to this theory the "medium," or the
circle of people associated together as a whole, is supposed
to possess a force, power, influence, virtue, or
gift, by means of which intelligent beings are enabled
to produce the phenomena observed. What these
intelligent beings are is a subject for other theories.</p>

<p>It is obvious that a "medium" possesses a <i>something</i>
which is not possessed by an ordinary being. Give
this <i>something</i> a name. Call it "<i>x</i>" if you like. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Serjeant Cox calls it Psychic Force. There has been
so much misunderstanding on this subject that I think
it best to give the following explanation in Mr. Serjeant
Cox's own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Theory of <i>Psychic Force</i> is in itself merely the
recognition of the now almost undisputed fact that
under certain conditions, as yet but imperfectly ascertained,
and within a limited, but as yet undefined,
distance from the bodies of certain persons
having a special nerve organization, a Force operates
by which, without muscular contact or connexion,
action at a distance is caused, and visible motions and
audible sounds are produced in solid substances. As
the presence of such an organization is necessary to
the phenomenon, it is reasonably concluded that the
Force does, in some manner as yet unknown, proceed
from that organization. As the organism is itself
moved and directed within its structure by a Force
which either is, or is controlled by, the Soul, Spirit,
or Mind (call it what we may) which constitutes the
individual being we term 'the Man,' it is an equally
reasonable conclusion that the Force which causes the
motions beyond the limits of the body is the same
Force that produces motion within the limits of the
body. And, inasmuch as the external force is seen to
be often directed by Intelligence, it is an equally
reasonable conclusion that the directing Intelligence
of the external force is the same Intelligence that
directs the Force internally. This is the force to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the name of <i>Psychic Force</i> has been given by me as
properly designating a force which I thus contend to
be traced back to the Soul or Mind of the Man as its
source. But I, and all who adopt this theory of
Psychic Force, as being the agent through which the
phenomena are produced, do not thereby intend to
assert that this Psychic Force may not be sometimes
seized and directed by some other Intelligence than
the Mind of the Psychic. The most ardent spiritualists
practically admit the existence of Psychic Force
under the very inappropriate name of Magnetism (to
which it has no affinity whatever), for they assert
that the Spirits of the Dead can only do the acts
attributed to them by using the Magnetism (that is,
the Psychic Force) of the Medium. The difference
between the advocates of Psychic Force and the
spiritualists consists in this&mdash;that we contend that
there is as yet insufficient proof of any other directing
agent than the Intelligence of the Medium, and no
proof whatever of the agency of Spirits of the Dead;
while the spiritualists hold it as a faith, not demanding
further proof, that Spirits of the Dead are the
sole agents in the production of all the phenomena.
Thus the controversy resolves itself into a pure question
of <i>fact</i>, only to be determined by a laborious and
long continued series of experiments and an extensive
collection of psychological facts, which should be the
first duty of the Psychological Society, the formation
of which is now in progress."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>It has frequently struck me, especially in connexion
with certain investigations that I have been making
during the last few years, that Spiritualism is going
through much the same phases as Positivism. It
seemed at first impossible that the Positive Philosophy
of Auguste Comte could culminate in a highly
ornate Religion of Humanity, with its fall ritual, its
ninefold sacramental system. It is even curious to
notice that it was the death of Clotilde which brought
about the change, by revealing to him the gap which
Philosophy always does leave between the present
and the future. So too Spiritualism is beginning to
"organize" and exhibits some symptoms of formulating
a Creed and Articles of Belief. The British
National Association of Spiritualists, which has
honoured me by placing my name on its Council,
thus states its principles, under the mottoes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He that answereth a matter before he heareth it,
it is folly and shame unto him."&mdash;Proverbs xviii. 13.</p>

<p>"In Scripture we are perpetually reminded that
the Laws of the Spiritual World are, in the highest
sense, Laws of Nature."&mdash;Argyll.</p>

<p>"He who asserts that, outside of the domain of
pure Mathematics, anything is impossible, lacks a
knowledge of the first principles of Logic."&mdash;Arago.</p>


<p class='center'><b><span class="smcap">declaration of principles and purposes.</span></b></p>

<p>"Spiritualism implies the recognition of an inner
nature in man. It deals with facts concerning that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
inner nature, the existence of which has been the
subject of speculation, dispute, and even of denial,
amongst philosophers in all ages; and in particular,
with certain manifestations of that inner nature which
have been observed in persons of peculiar organizations,
now called Mediums or Sensitives, and in
ancient times Prophets, Priests, and Seers.</p>

<p>"Spiritualism claims to have established on a firm
scientific basis the immortality of man, the permanence
of his individuality, and the Open Communion,
under suitable conditions, of the living with
the so-called dead, and affords grounds for the belief
in progressive spiritual states in new spheres of
existence.</p>

<p>"Spiritualism furnishes the key to the better understanding
of all religions, ancient and modern. It
explains the philosophy of Inspiration, and supersedes
the popular notion of the miraculous by the revelation
of hitherto unrecognised laws.</p>

<p>"Spiritualism tends to abrogate exaggerated class
distinctions; to reunite those who are now too often
divided by seemingly conflicting material interests;
to encourage the co-operation of men and women in
many new spheres; and to uphold the freedom and
rights of the individual, while maintaining as paramount
the sanctity of family life.</p>

<p>"Finally, the general influence of Spiritualism on the
individual is to inspire him with self-respect, with a
love of justice and truth, with a reverence for Divine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
law, and with a sense of harmony between man, the
universe, and God.</p>

<p>"The British National Association of Spiritualists is
formed to unite Spiritualists of every variety of opinion,
for their mutual aid and benefit; to promote the
study of Pneumatology and Psychology; to aid
students and inquirers in their researches, by placing
at their disposal the means of systematic investigation
into the now recognised facts and phenomena, called
Spiritual or Psychic; to make known the positive
results arrived at by careful scientific research; and to
direct attention to the beneficial influence which those
results are calculated to exercise upon social relationships
and individual conduct. It is intended to include
spiritualists of every class, whether members of
Local and Provincial Societies or not, and all inquirers
into psychological and kindred phenomena.</p>

<p>"The Association, whilst cordially sympathizing
with the teachings of Jesus Christ, will hold itself
entirely aloof from all dogmatism or finalities, whether
religious or philosophical, and will content itself with
the establishment and elucidation of well-attested
facts, as the only basis on which any true religion or
philosophy can be built up."</p>

<p>This last clause has, I believe, been modified to
suit certain members of my profession who were a
little staggered by its apparent <i>patronizing</i> of Christianity.
For myself (but then, I am unorthodox) I
care little for these written or printed symbola.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Having strained my conscience to join the Dialecticians,
I allow my name, without compunction, to
stand on the Council of the Association,&mdash;and shall
be really glad if it does them any good. The fact is,
I care little for formal creeds, but much for the fruit
of those creeds. I stand by that good old principle&mdash;"By
their fruits ye shall know them;" and that
reminds me that to my shreds and patches of
"experience" I am to append some pros and
cons of this matter. They have cropped up incidentally
as we have gone on: but I could with
advantage collect them if my limits admitted of
sermonizing.</p>

<p>As to the fruits of Spiritualism, I can only say that
I have never witnessed any of these anti-Christianizing
effects which some persons say arise from a belief in
Spiritualism. They simply have not come within the
sphere of my observation, nor do I see any tendency
towards them in the tenets of Spiritualism&mdash;rather the
reverse.</p>

<p>Then again, to pass from practice to faith, Spiritualism
professes to be the reverse of exclusive. In
addressing the Conference of 1874, and defending my
position as a clerical inquirer, I was able to say:&mdash;"On
the broad question of theology I can conceive
no single subject which a clergyman is more bound
to examine than that which purports to be a new
revelation, or, at all events, a large extension of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
old; and which, if its claims be substantiated, will
quite modify our notions as to what we now call
faith. It proposes, in fact, to supply in matters we
have been accustomed to take on trust, something so
like demonstration, that I feel not only at liberty, but
actually bound, whether I like it or not, to look into
the thing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Whether your creed is right or wrong is not for me
to tell you; but it is most important for me that I
should assure myself. And while I recognise that
my own duty clearly is to examine the principles
you profess, I find this to be eminently their characteristic,
<i>that they readily assimilate with those of my own
Church</i>. I see nothing revolutionary in them. You
have no propaganda. You do not call upon me, as
far as I understand, to come out of the body I belong
to and join yours, as so many other bodies do; but
you ask me simply to take your doctrines into my own
creed, and vitalize it by their means. That has
always attracted me powerfully towards you. You
are the broadest Churchmen I find anywhere."</p>

<p>I am not writing thus in any sense as the apologist
of Spiritualism. I am not offering anything like an
Apologia pro vit&acirc; me&acirc; in making the inquiries I have
done, am doing, and hope to do. I have elected to
take, and I elect to maintain, a neutral position in
this matter. All I have done is to select from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Pros and Cons that present themselves to my mind.
If the Pros seem to outweigh the Cons&mdash;or vice
vers&acirc;&mdash;be it so. I cannot help it. I have scarcely
decided for myself yet, and I am a veteran investigator.
Others may be more speedy in arriving at a
conclusion.</p>

<p>Among the more obvious "Cons" are the oft-quoted
facts that some people have lost their heads and
wasted a good deal of their time on Spiritualism.
But people lose their heads by reading classics or
mathematics, or overdoing any one subject however
excellent&mdash;even falling in love: and the ingenuity
displayed in wasting time is so manifold that
this is an objection that can scarcely be urged specially
against Spiritualism, though I own Dark S&eacute;ances do
cut terribly into time.</p>

<p>Then again one is apt to be taken in by mediums
or even by spirits. Yes; but this only imposes the
ordinary obligation of keeping one's eyes open. I
know spiritualists who believe in every medium qu&acirc;
medium, and others who accept as unwritten gospel
the idiotic utterances of a departed buccaneer or
defunct clown: but these people are so purely exceptional
as simply to prove a rule. Do <i>not</i> accept
as final in so-called spiritual what you would not
accept in avowedly mundane matters. Keep your
eyes open and your head cool, and you will not go far
wrong. These are the simple rules that I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
elaborated during my protracted study of the
subject.</p>

<p>"We do not believe, we know," was, as I said, the
proud boast a spiritualist once made to me. And if
the facts&mdash;any of the facts&mdash;of Spiritualism stand
<i>as</i> facts, there is no doubt that it would form the
strongest possible counterpoise to the materialism
of our age. It presses the method of materialism
into its service, and meets the doubter on his own
ground of demonstration&mdash;a low ground, perhaps,
but a tremendously decisive one, the very one perhaps
on which the Battle of Faith and Reason will have to
be fought out.</p>

<p>If&mdash;let us not forget that pregnant monosyllable&mdash;if
the assumptions of Spiritualism be true, and that
we can only ascertain by personal investigation, I
believe the circumstance would be efficacious in bringing
back much of the old meaning of the word <span class="correction" title="pistis">&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>
which was something more than the slipshod Faith
standing as its modern equivalent. It would make
it really the substance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not seen.</p>

<p>Even if the dangers of Spiritualism were much
greater than they are&mdash;aye, as great as the diabolical
people themselves make out&mdash;I should still think
(in the cautious words of the Dialecticians) Spiritualism
was worth looking into, if only on the bare chance,
however remote, of lighting on some such Philosophy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
as that so beautifully sketched by Mr. S. C. Hall in
some of the concluding stanzas of his poem "Philosophy,"
with which I may fitly conclude&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And those we call "the dead" (who are not dead&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Death was their herald to Celestial Life)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May soothe the aching heart and weary head<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In pain, in toil, in sorrow, and in strife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That is a part of every natural creed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Instinctive teaching of another state:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When manacles of earth are loosed and freed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which Science vainly strives to dissipate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In tortuous paths, with prompters blind, we trust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One Guide&mdash;to lead us forth and set us free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us, Lord God! all merciful and just!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The <span class="smcap">Faith</span> that is but Confidence in Thee!<br /></span>
</div></div>
